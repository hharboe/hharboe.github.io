            <h1>RESEARCH</h1>
            <h2>INITIAL VISION</h2>
            <p>LumenEd's inspiration came from appreciation for the growing culture of video-based education in the US, and concern over its inaccessibility in underprivileged parts of the world.</p>

            <p>Using the latest projector, video camera, and micro-PC technology, we saw an opportunity to design a portable, "smart projector” for classrooms. We thought this concept would compete on price and classroom infrastructure requirements, compared to other classroom technology alternatives.</p>
            <h2>PILOTS & FIELD TESTS</h2>
            <p>We tested the concept in summer 2013 with a retail projector preloaded with educational videos. We brought the projector to underresourced classrooms in New Delhi, and asked for feedback.</p>

           <h2>THREE PRODUCT DIRECTIONS</h2>
           <p>With $10k from social impact grants and a pitch competition, we set out to test two applications of our prototype: playing video content, and facilitating a video exchange program between classrooms. Field testing led to several conclusions:</p>

           <p>Spring through summer 2014 was devoted to design, assembly, and shipment of our BOB prototypes. We ran into numerous headaches throughout this process, teaching us that pursuing BOBs in the future would be best accomplished through a professional manufacturer.</p>
           <h3>CONTENT IS NOT A PRIORITY</h3>

           <p>We found three schools in the US willing to participate in a video exchange project with our Indian school partners over the summer. With support from our team, these classrooms sent numerous video diaries to each other over three months, covering their lives at school, their local communities, and favorite cultural practices.</p>
           <p>Students on both sides of the exchange had wonderful experiences filming videos in their classrooms, and seeing videos from their new friends abroad. The biggest takeaways were that Indian classrooms needed hardware to participate, and US classrooms were enthusiastic enough to pay for the experience again.</p>
           <h2>EXPLORING 'GLOBAL EDUCATION'</h2>
           <p>Following the success of our video exchanges, we wanted to learn more about ‘global education,’ a growing trend in American K-8 schools curricula. One common approach we found was DIY classroom projects organized by proactive, globally-minded teachers.</p>
           <p>We spoke with two organizations and one startup assisting teachers with these projects, and asked what factors they felt were most crucial to success. We coupled their responses with feedback from our pilot program teachers to create a list of requirements for our own program.</p>

           <h3>MULTIPLE LEARNING APPROACHES</h3>
           <p>We put our program's unique, multi-layered pedalogical approach at the front of our marketing materials. This included two distinct topic areas designed for a younger and older group of students.</p>

           <h2>INCORPORATING THE 'BOB'</h2>
           <p>As an organization, we saw a path forward that dropped the Bright Orange Box and focused on selling Video Pen Pals to well-off schools already equipped with technology. While this would be a low-risk business direction, it would be a partial abandonment of our founding mission and traction using the BOB to impact offline, disconnected classrooms.</p>
           <p>We decided to pursue a dual-focused path for the upcoming year: earn revenue from schools through Video Pen Pals, and invest funds into BOB manufacturing. If we were successful, distributing BOBs to a diverse set of international NGOs would eventually yield its own revenue, and simultaneously expand the reach of Video Pen Pals.</p>

             <h1>GROWTH</h1>
             <h2>FUNDRAISING CHALLENGES</h2>
             <p>After deciding to pursue LumenEd full-time after school, we set a goal to raise $200k by the day we graduated. These funds would support a year of operations and a manufacturing run of 250 Bright Orange Boxes. Our primary fundraising sources were classroom pre-sales and a Kickstarter campaign. We also began sending applications to social impact grants and looking to network with angel investors.</p>
             <h3>PRE-SALES ARE RARE IN EDTECH</h3>
             <p>Pre-sales were our preferred fundraising method, as we knew early sales traction would make us more attractive to investors. We tested this approach in March with our pilot schools, offering a 25% discount and special perks in exchange for an early commitment to the fall. While every pilot school was interested in the opportunity, not one was able to commit funds so early.</p>

              <h2>THREE YEARS OF EDTECH</h2>
              <p>LumenEd’s life as a company started on stage at a pitch competition in Ohio, where three college juniors held a cardboard box containing an OEM projector connected to a Raspberry Pi. Three years later, we sat in our apartment/office in Chicago, adding custom wax seals to 75 sales letters—a last-ditch effort to earn enough to stay afloat. At this time, we had four employees working in New Delhi, thirty custom projectors deployed to Indian classrooms, and $0 in our bank accounts.</p>

            <h1>BACKSTORY</h1>
    				<h2>WHY A PROJECTOR IN A CLASSROOM?</h2>
    				<p>Inspiration for LumenEd came in 2013 from the growing culture of video-based education in the US, and the pervasive inaccessibility of online videos in underprivileged parts of the world. We had a simple question: how would previously disconnected classrooms take advantage of access to educational content, and the ability to record and share their own videos?</p>

            <p>We made a direct comparison to <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> and the <a href="http://one.laptop.org">One Laptop Per Child</a> project. Instead of helping young programmers learn to code, we aimed to help classrooms access and record their own educational videos. We hoped this initiative would empower students to learn, share their unique perspectives, and even make an impact on their local community.</p>

    				<blockquote>"We hoped this initiative would empower students to learn, share their unique perspectives, and perhaps make an impact on their local community."</blockquote>
    				<div class="line-mid"></div>
    				<p>To facilitate this, we saw an opportunity to use the latest low-cost projector technology in the classroom. Our hunch was that a smart projector that played videos, recorded videos, and connected to the internet would serve as the optimal hub for content consumption and creation. In contrast to One Laptop Per Child, a single projector in underpriviliged classrooms could actually be an improvement over multiple laptops, at a fraction of the cost.</p>

            <p>In summer 2013, one of our co-founders brought a retail projector, preloaded with educational videos, to a few underresourced classrooms in New Delhi. After interviews with teachers and students, we found lots of enthusiasm for the concept.</p>

            <h2>TESTING THREE PRODUCT APPROACHES</h2>
    				<p>The following summer, we wanted to return to India to test a custom smart projector. Our intentions were to test this hardware in two applications: playing video content in Indian classrooms, and facilitating a video exchange program between classrooms.</p>
    				<p>In winter 2014, we applied for social impact grants and won a startup pitch competition that, together, funded $10k of our travel and development costs. We learned several lessons from this process.</p>
            <h3>HARDWARE IS... HARD</h3>

            <p>From the end of spring into summer 2014, much of our time was devoted to the design, assembly, and shipment of our BOB prototypes. We ran into numerous headaches throughout this process, teaching us that pursuing BOBs in the future would be best accomplished through a professional manufacturer.</p>
    				<p>Teachers' feedback on the BOB was positive. They said the projector commanded students attention and opened the door to projects that weren't previously possible. We knew we couldn't sell the BOB directly to schools, and selling to the government would be challenging, so we were in search for a sustainable hardware business model.</p>
    				<h3>TEACHERS PREFER THEIR OWN CONTENT</h3>

            <p>We were unsure if teachers would be capable or motivated to find their own educational videos, so we made an attempt to pre-loading BOBs with a library of videos mapped to Indian educational standards.</p>
    				<p>We curated a <a>library of open-source videos</a>, and built a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igdEv8es-TA">simple app interface</a> teachers could use to browse content. Teachers appreciated the gesture, but we learned that they	 ultimately prefer finding and playing their own materials.</p>

            <p>We found three schools in the US willing to participate in a video exchange project with our Indian school partners over the summer. With support from our team, these classrooms sent numerous video diaries to each other over three months, covering their lives at school, their local communities, and favorite cultural practices.</p>
    				<div class="line-light"></div>
    				<blockquote>"Students on both sides of the exchange had wonderful experiences... and US classrooms were enthusiastic enough to pay for the experience again."</blockquote>
    				<div class="line-light"></div>
    				<p>The concept was a success. Students on both sides of the exchange had wonderful experiences filming videos in their classrooms, and seeing videos from their new friends abroad. The biggest takeaways were that Indian classrooms needed hardware to participate, and US classrooms were enthusiastic enough to pay for the experience again.</p>

    				<h2>IMMERSING OURSELVES IN 'GLOBAL EDUCATION'</h2>
    				<p>We came back from our pilot wanting to learn more about what 'global education' means to American K-8 schools. It was a topic growing in popularity across American school curricula, and had become an institution-wide focus for some schools and <a href="https://gebg.org">consortiums</a>. One popular and affordable approach to global education we found was organizing projects between international classrooms.</p>
    				<p>We spoke with <a href="https://iearn.org/about">two</a> <a href = "http://www.globaleducationconference.org/page/our-mission">organizations</a> and <a href="http://www.penpalschools.com">one startup</a> assisting teachers with these projects, and asked what factors they felt were most crucial to success. We coupled their responses with feedback from our pilot program teachers to create a list of requirements for our own program.</p>

              <h4>PROJECT GOALS</h4>
    						<ul>
    							<li>Teachers have unique project ideas they want their students to collaborate on with partners abroad. This generally includes writing, reading, presentating, and sometimes an artistic element.</li>
    							<li>Teachers have a hard time finding classrooms to partner with. Once they find a partner, communicating clear expecations and maintaining a relationship is a significant challenge.</li>

              <h4>TECHNICAL PAIN POINTS</h4>
    						<ul>
    							<li>Timezone and language differences can complicate communication in myriad ways. Skype is often unusable due to these factors, in addition to unpredictable internet quality</li>
    							<li>Teachers use whatever tools they can find to make these projects happen. Email, Google Drive, and Twitter, and message boards are popular ways to share materials.</li>

            <h3 style = "padding-top: 1.5em">MULTI-LAYERED LEARNING APPROACH</h3>

            <h2>INCORPORATING THE BRIGHT ORANGE BOX</h2>
  					<p>As an organization, we saw a path forward that dropped the Bright Orange Box and focused on selling Video Pen Pals to well-off schools already equipped with technology. While this would be a low-risk business direction, it would be a partial abandonment of our founding mission and traction using the BOB to impact offline, disconnected classrooms.</p>

  					<blockquote>"We saw a path forward that dropped the Bright Orange Box... While this would be a low-risk business direction, it would be a partial abandonment of our founding mission."</blockquote>
  					<div class="line-mid"></div>
  					<p>We decided to pursue a dual-focused path for the upcoming year: earn revenue from schools through Video Pen Pals, and invest funds into BOB manufacturing. Distributing BOBs to a diverse set of international NGOs would eventually yield its own revenue, and simultaneously expand the reach of Video Pen Pals. The model was risky and complicated, but would fully satisfy our mission if successful.</p>

              <h1>TRANSITIONING TO FULL-TIME</h1>
    					<h2>FUNDRAISING CHALLENGES</h2>
    					<p>After deciding to pursue LumenEd full-time after school, we set a goal to raise $200k by the day we graduated. These funds would support a year of operations and a manufacturing run of 250 Bright Orange Boxes. Our primary fundraising sources were classroom pre-sales and a Kickstarter campaign. We also began sending applications to social impact grants and looking to network with angel investors.</p>
    					<h3>PRE-SALES ARE RARE IN EDTECH</h3>
    					<p>Pre-sales were our preferred fundraising method, as we knew early sales traction would make us more attractive to investors. We tested this approach in March with our pilot schools, offering a 25% discount and special perks in exchange for an early commitment to the fall. While every pilot school was interested in the opportunity, not one was able to commit funds so early.</p>

              <p>As the year went by, we gained more traction by writing to more schools. We made sales trips over Spring Break to schools in Cleveland, New York, and D.C., where we were able to secure about $10k in our accounts receivable that summer.</p>
    					<h3>KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGNS CAN BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING</h3>
    					<p>Succeeding on Kickstarter would simultaneously raise capital, and earn us a story in EdTech journals that may catch attention from prospective schools. We went through several drafts of campaign videos, award ideas, and outreach to news outlets before our campaignwent live, a process that took significantly longer than expected.</p>

              <p>We didn't have enough time to get many verbal commitments ahead of time, so outreach to friends, family, and alumni was an all-hands task while the campaign was live. We <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1066037724/the-bright-orange-box-connecting-classrooms">succeeded in raising $40,000</a> one day before our deadline, in large part due to generosity and interest from Oberlin College alumni.</p>
    					<p>The day after we graduated, we moved into a temporary office in Oberlin for the summer. We had a total of $50k to assemble 50 units of the new Bright Orange Box. Much of my time the next two months would be spent selling Video Pen Pals to K-8 schools, our sole source of revenue for the upcoming year.</p>

              <h2>FULL-TIME DIRECT SALES</h2>
      				<p>Our sales strategy began with a focus on direct sales top-tier K-8 schools across the US, in particular those with a service- or global education-related mission statement. We started charging $2000 per classroom per year, which we explained sponsored a Bright Orange Box for a partner classroom and covered our overhead costs. The first schools we enrolled accepted this price graciously, enrolling multiple classrooms for an average deal-size of $4000 per school. </p>
      				<p>As we got further into the summer, we found that $2000 per classroom was prohibitive for most schools. We started discounting after honest conversations with schools' on their ability-to-pay, and  our lowest price dropped to $399 per classroom per year. This new price was unsustainable in our current hardware-driven model, informing us that costs had to be cut before our program could scale.</p>

      				<blockquote>"This new price was unsustainable in our current hardware-driven model, informing us that costs had to be cut before our program could scale."</blockquote>
      				<div id="line"></div>
      				<p> We left the summer with $45,000 in revenue from direct sales. Direct sales, while effective at communicating our unique value and justifying our price point, lead to less sales volume than we hoped. We planned to find additional sales channels in the future aside from repeating our lengthy, high-touch approach.</p>
      				<h2>LAUNCHING PARTNERSHIPS AND PRODUCTS</h2>
      				<p>With our summer lease up, we moved operations to Chicago in the fall where we would release our video exchange software, finish BOB assembly, and launch Video Pen Pals with 25 classrooms on each side. We hit other milestones along the way:

Our third reason was to replace our full-year discounted program with a single-unit program at the same price. This would allow us to include small budget schools in our program, without enduring the overhead cost of managing a full-year program.</p>

    					<h2>LAST CALL FOR FUNDRAISING</h2>
    					<p>By the end of winter, we were in desperate need of outside fundraising. We had exhausted all our cash, and were borrowing funds from friends and family to cover our $5k/month burn rate. We had some revenue coming in from BOB sales, but the bulk of our income from Video Pen Pals would not arrive for several months.</p>
    					<h3>PUSHING CHICAGO'S INVESTOR NETWORK</h3>
    					<p>Our advisor network attempted to connect us with local angel investors, including several people at Chicago's primary entrepreneurship center, <a href="https://1871.com/">1871</a>. We were able to network with local startups and pitch at two new startup competitions at 1871, but in the end none of these connections lead to fundraising traction.</p>

This new debt would not cover our growth expenses, which included increased sales and marketing and several software updates. Our only options forward were to raise funds or secure early pre-sales.</p>
              <h3>HONEST COMMUNICATION WITH SCHOOLS</h3>
    					<p>Frustrated with our fundraising network in Chicago, we turned to our highest-profile schools for help. We sent 75 schools a personalized letter, explaining that we wanted to offer the program again, but could not guarantee we could afford it.
