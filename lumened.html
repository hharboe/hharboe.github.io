	      <h1>LUMENED: CONNECTING CLASSROOMS</h1>
	      <p>LumenEd was the education technology startup I co-founded my junior year at Oberlin College, and worked on full-time post-graduation. We designed and shipped a hardware, software, and curriculum product package to K-12 classrooms. For every package sold, we donated the equivalent to an underprivileged classroom in India.</p></section>
			<section class="dark end">
				<h1>MY ROLE</h1>
				<p>I was one of three co-founders, and the design, sales, and marketing lead. In addition to grunt work and strategic planning as co-founder, my responsibilities included curriculum and software design, sales to K-12 schools, and designing our web, print, and video materials.</p>
				<p>My two co-founders, <a href="http://prakashpaudel.com">Prakash Paudel</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@tkreek">Thomas Kreek</a>, lead software development, fundraising, and hardware development.</p></section>

				<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
			  <h1>THREE YEARS AND COUNTING</h1>
			  <p>LumenEd’s life as a company started on stage at a pitch competition in Ohio, where three college juniors held a cardboard box containing an OEM projector connected to a Raspberry Pi. Three years later, we sat in our apartment/office in Chicago, adding custom wax seals to 150 sales letters—a last-ditch effort to earn enough to stay afloat. At this time, we had four employees working in New Delhi, thirty custom projectors deployed to classrooms around India, and absolutely $0 in our bank accounts.</p></section>

				<img style = "max-width: 350px" src = "/images/letters.png"></figure>
			<section class = "light">
				<p>Over the course of three years, our products included <em>The Bright Orange Box</em>: a battery-powered smart projector designed for offline classrooms, and <em>Video Pen Pals</em>: a classroom-to-classroom relationship for K-8 students. When we officially closed in summer 2016, we had deployed thirty units of "BOB", and were ready to start our third consecutive year running Video Pen Pals.</p></section>

				<h2>BACKSTORY</h2>
				<h1>WHY A PROJECTOR IN A CLASSROOM?</h1>
				<p>Inspiration for LumenEd came in 2013 from the growing culture of video-based education in the US, and the pervasive inaccessibility of online videos in underprivileged parts of the world. We had a simple question: how would previously disconnected classrooms take advantage of access to educational content, and the ability to record and share their own videos?</p></section>
			<figure class = "small dark">
				<img style = "max-width: 261px; padding: 0" src = "/images/olpc.png">
				<img style = "max-width: 261px" src = "/images/youtube.png">
				<img style = "max-width: 261px" src = "/images/khan.png">
				</figure>
			<section class = "dark end" id="row10">
				<p>We made a direct comparison to the Khan Academy and the One Laptop Per Child project. Instead of helping young programmers learn to code, we wanted to help classrooms access and record their own educational videos. We hoped this initiative would empower students to learn, share their unique perspectives, and even make an impact on their local community.</p>
				<div id="line"></div>
				<blockquote>"We hoped this initiative would empower students to learn, share their unique perspectives, and perhaps make an impact on their local community."</blockquote>
				<div id="line"></div>
				<p>To facilitate this, we saw an opportunity to use the latest low-cost projector technology in the classroom. Our hunch was that a smart projector that played videos, recorded videos, and connected to the internet would serve as a hub for content consumption and creation. In contrast to One Laptop Per Child, a single projector in the classroom could be an improvement over multiple laptops, at a fraction of the cost.</p></section>
				<aside style="padding-top: 27.5em" class="comment" id="row10">Our motto and mantra at the time was, "With a portable projector, you only need a wall to learn."</aside>
			<section class = "light" id="row11">
				<h2>PILOTS & PROTOTYPES</h2>
				<h1>EARLY PROOF OF CONCEPT</h1>
				<p>In summer 2013, one of our co-founders brought a retail projector, preloaded with educational videos, to a few underresourced classrooms in New Delhi. After interviews with teachers and students, we found lots of enthusiasm for the concept.</p></section>

				<img src = "/images/pilot1.png">
				<img src = "/images/pilot2.png">
				</figure>
			<section class = "light break-end">
				<p>With motivation to return the following summer, we observed and documented technical requirements that would be necessary for stand-alone, custom projector.</p></section>
			<figure class="data-figure">
				<h3>EARLY INSIGHTS FROM THE PILOT</h3>
				<div class="data-container">
					<div class ="data-details paragraph">
						<ul>
							<li style="padding-top: 0em"><b>Portable</b><br>Projectors should be portable, so that teachers can share them between classrooms, and take them home at night</li>
							<li><b>Battery-powered</b><br>Many classrooms have no plug points, and power outages are common. Projectors must be battery-powered</li>
							<li><b>3G-connectivity</b><br>There is no wifi access in most classrooms, but prevalent 2G and 3G network access. Some teachers have wifi at home to facilitate larger data requests</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class ="data-details paragraph">
						<ul>
							<li style="padding-top: 0em"><b>Visible in daylight</b><br>Many classrooms are without infrastructure to make a room dark enough for low-brightness projectors High brightness is required for children to see content clearly.</li>
							<li><b>Louder than chatter</b><br>It's common for elementary school classrooms to have 30-50 students in India. Speakers must be loud enough to play over ambient chatter and background noises from the rest of the school</li>
							<li><b>Simple interface</b><br>Many students and teachers are unfamiliar with projectors and media players. Interfaces need to be simple enough for a child to understand it</li>
						</ul>

					<!-- <section class = "light break-start"><p>We hoped to return a year after our first pilot with a custom projector that addressed the painpoints we documented. We also wanted to test two complementary concepts: a video exchange program for classrooms, and a library of open-source educational videos.</p></section> -->
			<section class = "light break-none" id="row15">
				<h1>TESTING THREE PRODUCT APPROACHES</h1>
				<p>A year after our first pilot, we wanted to test a custom projector in the classroom, in addition to two complementary services: a video exchange program for classrooms, and a library of open-source educational videos. In winter 2014, we applied for social impact grants and won a startup pitch competition that, together, funded $10k of our travel and development costs. We learned several lessons from this process.</p>
				<h3 style = "padding-top: 1.5em">HARDWARE IS... HARD</h3></section>
				<aside class = "comment" id="row15" style="padding-top: 7.5em">Because we were unsure how to fund the devices on their own, we thought of the the Video Pen Pal concept as a complementary service that had the potential to generate revenue for the BOB</aside>

					<img style = "max-width: 338px" src = "/images/pilot3-2.png">
					<img style = "max-width: 338px" src = "/images/pilot8.png"></figure>
				<section class = "light break-none">
				<p>From the end of spring into summer 2014, much of our time was devoted to design and assembly of our BOB prototypes. This included programming Raspberry Pis, breaking down OEM projectors, laser-cutting our enclosure, and laying out components in an efficient and secure package.</p>
				<p>We ran into numerous headaches during the assembly process, and even more when shipping and servicing the projectors in India. Ultimately, teachers were thrilled to have the Bright Orange Box in the classroom. Playing videos in the classroom commanded students attention, and opened the door to countless project possibilities that previously weren't possible.</p>
				<h3 style = "padding-top: 1.5em">TEACHERS PREFER THEIR OWN CONTENT</h3></section>
				<figure class = "small light break-none">
					<img style = "max-width: 338px" src = "/images/pilot4-2.png">
					<img style = "max-width: 338px" src = "/images/pilot7.png"></figure>
				<section class = "light break-none">
					<p>One approach we considered was providing a library of educational videos, mapped to Indian educational standards (CBSE/ICSE), and preloaded to our projectors. We were unsure if teachers would have the capabilitiy or motivation to find high-quality educational videos to supplement their lesson plans.</p>
					<p>Our second pilot confirmed this was an unnecessary focus. While teachers appreciated us curating a <a>library of open-source content</a>, they were ultimately preferred to find their own materials.</p>
				<h3 style = "padding-top: 1.5em">VIDEO EXCHANGES ARE A SUCCESS</h3></section>
				<figure class = "small light break-none">
					<img style = "max-width: 338px" src = "/images/pilot5.png">
					<img style = "max-width: 338px" src = "/images/pilot6.png"></figure>
				<section class = "light end">
					<p>We found three schools in the US and three in India willing to participate in our video exchange project over the summer. With support from our team, classrooms sent numerous video diaries to each other over the course of three months, talking about their lives at school, their local communities, and favorite cultural practices.</p>

					<div id="line"></div>
					<blockquote>"Students on both sides of the exchange had wonderful experiences... and US classrooms were enthusiastic enough to pay for the experience again."</blockquote>
					<div id="line"></div>

					<p>The concept was a resounding success. Students on both sides of the exchange had wonderful experiences filming videos in their classrooms, and seeing videos from their new friends abroad. The biggest takeaways were that Indian classrooms needed hardware to participate, and US classrooms were enthusiastic enough to pay for the experience again.</p>

					<!-- <p>We considered a model where US classrooms received this service in exchange for sponsoring their partner's device. With more research, we realized this concept may fill a gap in the K-12 market for accessible international experiences.</p> -->
					<!-- <p>It was that we began to take the business model of US-classroom-subscriptions more seriously.</p> -->

					<h2>PRODUCT & SERVICE DESIGN</h2>
					<h1>IMMERSING OURSELVES IN 'GLOBAL EDUCATION'</h1>
					<p>We came back from our pilot wanting to learn more about what 'global education' means to American K-12 schools. It turns out, global education is a core part of the curriculum for many grade levels, even an institution-wide focus for some schools and consortiums. Touted as a national priority by the  <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/michelle-obama-value-global-education">Obama administration</a>, it seemed to be a hot topic growing in popularity.</p>
					<p>We wanted to learn more about the tools and services proactive teachers use to organize their international classroom projects. In 2014, we spoke with <a href="https://iearn.org/about">two</a> <a href = "http://www.globaleducationconference.org/page/our-mission">organizations</a> and <a href="http://www.penpalschools.com">one startup</a> working on this problem, and asked them about best practices and common frustrations they hear from teachers. We coupled their responses with feedback from our pilot program teachers to create a list of requirements for a global project platform.</p></section>
				<!-- <aside style="padding-top: 12em" class="comment" id="row22">90% of K-12 administrators  say they want to increase global competency offerings in their schools</aside> -->
				<aside class="comment" id="row22" style="padding-top: 22em">Finding a startup with a similar product offering, but lacking a video component, was more encouraging than frightening to us at the time.</aside>

					<h3>GLOBAL PROJECT OBSERVATIONS</h3>
					<div class="data-container">
						<div class ="data-details paragraph">
							<h4>PROJECT GOALS</h4>
							<ul>
								<li style="padding-top: 0em">Teachers have unique project ideas they want their students to collaborate on with partners abroad. This generally includes writing, reading, presentating, and sometimes an artistic element.</li>
								<li>Teachers have a hard time finding classrooms to partner with. Once they find a partner, communicating clear expecations and maintaining a relationship is a significant challenge.</li>
							</ul></div>
							<div class ="data-details paragraph">
							<h4>TECHNICAL PAIN POINTS</h4>
							<ul>
								<li style="padding-top: 0em">Timezone and language differences can complicate communication in myriad ways. Skype is often unusable due to these factors, in addition to unpredictable internet quality</li>
								<li>Teachers use whatever tools they can find to make these projects happen. Email, Google Drive, and Twitter, and message boards are popular ways to share materials.</li>
							</ul></div>
						<div class ="data-details paragraph">
							<h4>FEEDBACK FROM PILOTS</h4>
							<ul>
								<li style="padding-top: 0em">Teachers have no problem recording videos or having students record videos, but editing is a process they could use help with</li>
								<li>Weekly exchanges were impractical, and monthly exchanges were too infrequent. Bi-weekly projects was a happy medium</li>
								<li>Older classrooms wanted to take an active role in the planning and editing of projects</li>
							</ul>

					<h1>CREATING A COMPELLING PROGRAM AROUND VIDEO</h1>
					<p>We were confident our video-based model, now called "Video Pen Pals," would fit the pedagogical interests outlined above, provided we could make teacher relationships and technology easier for teachers. We ran with the idea more, and drafted a website with mockups of curriculum, software, and pre- enrollment details to pique interest and address concerns of prospective schools.</p>
					<h3 style = "padding-top: 1.5em">MULTI-LAYERED LEARNING APPROACH</h3>
					<p>We put our program's unique, multi-layered pedalogical approach at the front of our marketing materials. This included two distinct topic areas designed for a younger and older group of students.</p>
					<figure class = "dark small">
						<img src="/images/curriculum_1.png" style="width: 400px; padding: 0 1em 0 1em">

					</figure>
					<h3 style = "padding-top: 1.5em">CONFIDENCE-BUILDING VIDEO SOFTWARE</h3>
					<p>Mockups of our video software emphasized simple recording and editing. With our messaging and video exchange portal, we tried to communicate that LumenEd was always available for support, and that the onus of program management was on us.<p>
					<figure class = "dark small">

					</figure>
					<h3 style = "padding-top: 1.5em">LOW-COMMITMENT EARLY ENROLLMENT</h3>
					<p>Our website used a low-commitment call-to-action, asking teachers to reserve a spot rather than pay and enroll early. This allowed us to learn more from our first customers, rather than isolate them with program details or pricing incompatible with their needs.</p>
					<figure class = "dark small">
						<img src="/images/website_1.png" style="width: 1000px; padding: 0 1em 0 1em">
					</figure>
					<p class="break-start">At this stage, we were confident building technology would be one of our simplest tasks going forward. We still had to market our program to schools, find international organizations with interest in the Bright Orange Box and our program, and finally, raise enough money for a manufacturing run of the BOB.</p>
					<h1>INCORPORATING THE BRIGHT ORANGE BOX</h1>
				</section>

				<section class = "light break-none" id="row25">
					<h2>TRANSITIONING TO FULL-TIME</h2>
					<h1>FUNDRAISING CHALLENGES</h1>
					<p>In the winter of our senior year, we made the decision to pursue LumenEd full-time after graduation. We hoped to raise $200k to support a year of operations and a manufacturing run of 250 Bright Orange Boxes. Our goal was to raise the funds by the day we graduated in May 2015.</p>
					<p>We had a three-prong strategy to fundraising: classroom pre-sales, a Kickstarter campaign, and a traditional round of angel fundraising. We learned many lessons along the way.</p>
					<h3 style = "padding-top: 1.5em">PRE-SALES ARE RARE IN EDTECH</h3>
					<p>Pre-sales were our preferred fundraising method, as we knew showing early sales traction would aid in discussions with investors. Nine months before our program start date, we tested this approach with our pilot schools, offering a 25% discount and special perks in exchange for an early commitment. While every pilot school was interested in the opportunity, no one was able to commit funds so early.</p>
					<figure class = "light small">
					<img src="/images/prakash_nyc.jpg" style = "height: 300px; padding: 0 1em 0 1em">
					<img src="/images/presales4.png" style = "height: 300px; padding: 0 1em 0 1em"></figure>
					<p>As the year went by, we continued writing to schools, and slowly gained more traction. Over spring break, we made sales trips to schools in Cleveland, New York, and Washington, D.C. where we were able to secure commitments from several schools, guaranteeing about $10k in our accounts receivable that summer.</p>
					<h3 style = "padding-top: 1.5em">KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGNS CAN BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING</h3>
					<p>We thought succeeding on Kickstarter would be a wise approach to raising capital, creating buzz around our program, and driving traffic to our pre-enrollment webpage. Going through the motions for the best chance of success took longer than expected, as we went through several drafts of campaign videos, award ideas, and proposals to news outlets to pick up our story.</p>
					<figure class = "light small">
						<img src="/images/shirts.jpg" style = "height: 300px; padding: 0 1em 0 1em">
						<img src="/images/kickstarter_video.png" style = "height: 300px; padding: 0 1em 0 1em"></figure>
					<p>We didn't have enough time to get many verbal commitments ahead of time, so outreach to friends, family, and high-profile alumni was an all-hands task while the campaign was live. We <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1066037724/the-bright-orange-box-connecting-classrooms">succeeded one day before our deadline</a>, in large part due to generosity and interest from Oberlin College alumni.</p>
					<h3 style = "padding-top: 1.5em">FUNDRAISING IN EDTECH REQUIRES SALES TRACTION</h3>
					<p>Our last approach to raising funds was through traditional angel fundraising. This was always in the back of our minds, but never a primary focus. The bottom-line was that we had very few sales, and an experimental business model in a long-term and low-profitability industry. We competed and won another pitch competition, which gave us the opportunity to refine our pitch deck. We also were able to raise some funding from NGOs, including the Clinton Global Initative.</p>

				<h1>FULL-TIME SALES</h1>
				<p>The day after we graduated, we moved into a temporary office in Oberlin for the summer. We had raised $50k, and would use most of it to assemble 50 units of our final BOB design in-house. Much of my time the next two months would be spent selling Video Pen Pals to K-12 schools, our sole source of revenue and funds for the upcoming year.</p>
				<!-- <figure class = "light small">
					<img src="/images/office.jpeg" style = "max-width: 680px">
				</figure> -->
				<h3 style = "padding-top: 1.5em">TAKING A DIRECT-TO-SCHOOLS APPROACH</h3>
				<p>Our sales strategy began with a focus on top-tier K-12 schools across the US, in particular those with a service- or global education-related mission statement. We estimated there were about 500 schools in the US who fit this profile, each of which had the potential for $5k contracts per year (a $2.5 million beachhead market).</p>
				<p>With this niche, high-end approach to sales, we focused on direct outreach to school administrators, heads of related departments, and in some cases, proactive teachers. We felt a personalized approach would benefit the social impact nature of our program, and help us justify a higher price.</p>
				<h3 style = "padding-top: 1.5em">FINDING THE RIGHT PRICE</h3>
				<p>We started by charging $2000 per classroom per year, which sponsored a Bright Orange Box for a partner classroom and covered our costs of management. The first schools we enrolled accepted this price graciously, enrolling multiple classrooms for an average deal-size of $4000 per school (right on our target). </p>
				<p>As we got further into the summer, we found that most schools thought $2000 per classroom was prohibitive. We had honest conversations to understand each schools' their ability to pay, and eventually offered discounts down to $399 per classroom. This was an unsustainable price at our current model, which informed us that we would love to cut costs significantly to scale our program.</p>
				<h3 style = "padding-top: 1.5em">CLOSING LATE IN THE SUMMER</h3>
				<p>While the first month of sales were sluggish, we became more successful mid-summer, eventually selling $45,000 worth of subscriptions. We had sent cold emails to over 500 institutions, of which 50 leads moved to sales calls, and 19 closed successfully. Persistence was essential, as each deal took one to two months from first contact to close.</p>
				<!-- <figure class = "light small">
					<img src="/images/sales_strategy.png" style = "max-width: 680px">
				</figure> -->
				<p>Our experience over the summer guided our plans for sales into the next few years. We hoped to continue marketing a premium program that included a Bright Orange Box sponsorship, but also add a software-only option at a more accessible price to public and mid-tier schools. Eventually, our goal was to scale to teacher and school organizations worldwide.</p>

				<h2>FULL-TIME IN CHICAGO, NEW DELHI</h2>
				<h1>SHIPPING PRODUCT AND SERVICE</h1>
				<p>With our summer lease up, we moved operations to Chicago to the fall where we would release our video exchange software, assemble our BOBs, and launch the Video Pen Pal program with 25 classrooms. With delays in releasing our software and hardware, and securing only half of our revenue target, our summer had not been as productive as we had hoped.</p>
				<h3 style = "padding-top: 1.5em">WORKING AROUND TECHNOLOGY DELAYS</h3>
				<p>While we hoped to assemble 50 BOBs over the summer, it took us the full three months to optimize the design, source parts, and finalize contracts with our dealers. Assembly was delayed until our move to Chicago.</p>
