		      <h1>LumenEd: Connecting Classrooms</h1>
  	      <p>I co-founded an edtech startup in 2013, my junior year of college. We bootstrapped our way to $45k in sales at graduation, and operated full-time through 2016. I was responsible for all software and marketing design, and led direct sales to schools.</p>
          <p>We shipped a software, hardware, and curriculum product to K–8 classrooms in the US and abroad.

          <h1>RESEARCH</h1>
          <h2>INITIAL VISION</h2>
          <p>LumenEd's inspiration came from appreciation for the growing culture of video-based education in the US, and concern over its inaccessibility in underprivileged parts of the world.</p>
        </div>

        </figure>
        <div class="copy">
          <p>Using the latest projector, video camera, and micro-PC technology, we saw an opportunity to design a portable <em>smart projector</em> for classrooms. We thought this would be a globally accessible platform for classroom media creation and playback.</p>
          <h2>PILOTS & FIELD TESTS</h2>
          <p>We tested the concept in summer 2013 with a retail projector preloaded with educational videos. We brought the projector to underresourced classrooms in New Delhi, and asked for feedback.</p>

          <h2>PRODUCT APPLICATIONS</h2>
          <p>With $10k from social impact grants and a pitch competition, we tested two applications of our prototype: playing video content, and facilitating a video exchange program between classrooms. Field testing led to several conclusions:</p>
          <h3>HARDWARE IS EFFECTIVE</h3>

        <div class="copy">
          <p>Spring through summer 2014 was devoted to design, assembly, and shipment of our BOB prototypes. We ran into numerous headaches throughout this process, teaching us that pursuing BOBs in the future would be best accomplished through a professional manufacturer.</p>
          <h3>CONTENT IS NOT A PRIORITY</h3>
        </div>
        <figure class = "fig-container-col">

          <p>To explore how much teachers appreciated video content coming pre-loaded on the BOB, we curated and shipped a <a>library of open-source videos</a> with our prototypes. We ultimately learned that teachers prefer to find and use their own materials.</p>
          <h3>CLASSROOM PARTNERSHIPS ARE LOVED</h3>

        <div class="copy">
          <p>We found three schools in the US willing to participate in a video exchange project with our Indian school partners over the summer. With support from our team, these classrooms sent numerous video diaries to each other over three months, covering their lives at school, their local communities, and favorite cultural practices.</p>
          <p>Students on both sides of the exchange had wonderful experiences filming videos in their classrooms, and seeing videos from their new friends abroad. The biggest takeaways were that Indian classrooms needed hardware to participate, and US classrooms were enthusiastic enough to pay for the experience again.</p>
          <h2>GLOBAL EDUCATION</h2>
          <p>Following the success of our video exchanges, we wanted to learn more about ‘global education,’ a growing trend in American K-8 schools curricula. One common approach we found was DIY classroom projects organized by proactive, globally-minded teachers.</p>
          <p>We spoke with two organizations and one startup assisting teachers with these projects, and asked what factors they felt were most crucial to success. We coupled their responses with feedback from our pilot program teachers to create a list of requirements for our own program.</p>

          <h2>PROGRAM DESIGN</h2>
          <p>We used our research findings to guide decisions as we fleshed out the details of our video exchange concept, now called <em>Video Pen Pals</em>. To communicate our offering to schools, we launched a website, with mockups of curricula and software products.</p>
          <h3>MULTIPLE LEARNING APPROACHES</h3>
          <p>We put our program's unique, multi-layered pedalogical approach at the front of our marketing materials. This included two distinct topic areas designed for a younger and older group of students.</p>

          <h1>GROWTH</h1>
          <h2>FUNDRAISING CHALLENGES</h2>
          <p>After deciding to pursue LumenEd full-time after school, we set a goal to raise $200k by the day we graduated. These funds would support a year of operations and a manufacturing run of 250 Bright Orange Boxes. We attempted three approaches to fundraising, and raised less than half our goal.</p>
          <h3>PRE-SALES ARE RARE IN EDTECH</h3>
          <p>Pre-sales were our preferred fundraising method, as we knew early sales traction would make us more attractive to investors. We tested this approach in March with our pilot schools, offering a 25% discount and special perks in exchange for an early commitment to the fall. While every pilot school was interested in the opportunity, not one was able to commit funds so early.</p>
