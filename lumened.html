	      <h1>LUMENED: CONNECTING CLASSROOMS</h1>
	      <p>LumenEd was the education technology startup I co-founded my junior year at Oberlin College, and worked on full-time after graduation. We shipped a hardware, software, and curriculum product package to K-12 classrooms. For every package sold, we donated the equivalent to an underprivileged classroom in India.</p></section>
			<section class="dark end">
				<h1>MY ROLE</h1>
				<p>I was one of three co-founders, and the design, sales, and marketing lead. In addition to plenty of grunt and strategic work as co-founder, my responsibilities included launching our curriculum and software product, leading our sales initiative with K-12 schools, and designing all our web, print, and video materials.</p>
				<p>My two co-founders, <a href="http://prakashpaudel.com">Prakash Paudel</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@tkreek">Thomas Kreek</a>, lead development/fundraising, and hardware development, respectively.</p></section>

				<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
			  <h1>THREE YEARS AND COUNTING...</h1>
			  <p>LumenEd’s traction started on stage in Ohio, at a pitch competition, where three college juniors held a cardboard box holding an OEM projector and Raspberry Pi. Three years later, we sat in our apartment/office in Chicago, adding custom wax seals to 150 sales letters as a last-ditch effort to reach our revenue targets. We had four employees working in New Delhi, thirty of our custom projectors deployed to classrooms around India, and absolutely $0 in our bank accounts.</p></section>

			<section class = "light">
				<p>Our products included “The Bright Orange Box” (BOB), a battery-powered smart projector designed for offline classrooms, and “Video Pen Pals,” a classroom-to-classroom relationship for K-8 students. At the time we ended operations in summer 2016, we had deployed thirty units of BOB, and were ready to start our third consecutive year of Video Pen Pals.</p></section>

			<section class = "light end">
				<p>Along the way, some highlights included:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Selling $45k in classroom subscriptions in our first three months of sales</li>
					<li>Raising $100k in grants, Kickstarter, and pre-seed investment</li>
					<li>Building a 150+ customer pipeline of American schools</li>
					<li>Hiring a team of 5 education superstars in our New Delhi office</li>
					<li>Deploying 30 custom projectors to Indian classrooms (many of which are still in use)</li>
					<li>Being a Keynote speaker at the 2015 Global Education Conference</li>
				</ul>
