				<p>Hi, I’m Henry, a “product person” in Brooklyn, NY. My <a href="/work.html#other">background</a> is in design consulting, with an emphasis on research, statistics, and information architecture. I also founded an <a href="/work.html#lumened">edtech startup</a>.</p><br>
				<p>I left my consulting job one year ago to take on my first freelance product design <a href="/work.html#michael">contract</a>. Now, I’m looking to join a product team, where my background will be valuable, and I can learn from more experienced researchers and designers.</p><br>
				<p>You can explore my <a href="/work.html">work</a>, browse my <a href="/journal.html">journal</a>, or read more about me below. Thanks for visiting!</p>

				<h2>MISSION</h2>
				<p>I find I'm happiest when helping people grow to become their best selves. In design, I believe this begins with personalized, discoverable education; and high-leverage, user-friendly tools.</p>

				<h2>MUSIC</h2>
				<p>Music has always been big in my life. I studied piano, saxophone, and guitar from grade school through college, and hosted a radio show on <a href="https://www.wobc.org/info/about" target="_blank">WOBC 91.5 FM</a> for four years. I still write and record new music, and you can follow me on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/henryharboe" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>.</p>

				<h2>FOCUS</h2>
				<p>I've always loved working on design and research problems, but it took me years as a founder, consultant, and now freelancer to understand where I best fit in.</p><br>
				<p>In a room of consultants, I’m advocating for end-users. In a room of engineers, I’m focusing on business objectives. I love using research and modeling to understand <em>why</em> a product works, and <em>where</em> it should go next.</p><br>
				<p>I've never worked within a large product team, and I'm still unsure where I belong between design and user research. That said, I've never been more excited to devote my time to a craft.</p>

				<h2>FUN</h2>
				<p>I’m not always this serious! I love hanging out in NYC parks and bodegas. I've never purchased an avocado toast. I'd probably love to meet ya!</p>
