      <p><br>ðŸ‘‹ Yo! I'm Henry, a product manager, ex-startup founder, and musician in Brooklyn. I grew up in the city of Chicago, and studied Economics at <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/" target="_blank">Oberlin College</a>.<br><br>
      I'm happiest when building tools that empower others to become their best selves. I've worked towards this by founding an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160416025920/http://www.lumened.org:80/" target="_blank">edtech company</a>, and working for a few <a href="/work.html" target="_blank">social impact startups</a>.<br><br>
      Academically, I'm interested in <a href="http://necsi.edu/" target="_blank">complex systems science</a>, and the psychology of habit. I think economists, complex system scientists, and UX researchers should design products together!<br><br>
      When I'm not working, you might find me <a href="https://soundcloud.com/henryharboe" target="_blank">recording music</a>, exploring NYC, or following the competitive scene of my favorite, 16-year-old, extremely nerdy <a href="https://warcraft3.info" target="_blank">real-time strategy game</a> ðŸ¤“</p>
      <!-- <h1>Mission</h1>
      <p>I'm interested in building tools that educate and promote people to create their best work.</p>
      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>Since graduating from <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/" target="_blank">Oberlin College</a> in 2015, I've been a <a href="/work.html">UX designer/ researcher</a>, <a href="https://idassoc.com" target="_blank">data analyst</a>, and <a href="https://tgggroup.com" target="_blank">behavioral economics consultant</a>.</p>
      <p>I also founded an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160416025920/http://www.lumened.org:80/" target="_blank">edtech startup</a> in 2013, and led design, marketing, and sales while we worked full-time from 2015â€“2016.</p>
      <h1>Complex Systems</h1>
      <p>I attended my first <a href="http://necsi.edu/" target="_blank">NECSI workshop</a> in January, which hooked me on the growing field of <a href="http://www.necsi.edu/guide/points.html" target="_blank">Complex Systems Science</a>. A personal goal for 2018 is to better grasp the methods of CSS research, and apply them to my work.</p>
      <h1>Music</h1>
      <p>I wrote for an <a href="https://twitter.com/inyourspeakers" target="_blank">indie music magazine</a> in high school, and hosted a radio show on <a href="https://www.wobc.org/info/about" target="_blank">WOBC 91.5 FM</a> for four years. I also record my own music, and post some of it on  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/henryharboe" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>.</p> -->
