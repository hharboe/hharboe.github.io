    <p>Guten tag! I'm Henry, a product designer, ex-startup founder, and musician living in Brooklyn. I grew up in the city of Chicago, and graduated from Oberlin College & Conservatory of Music in Ohio.</p>
    <p>I've always been happiest when helping other people. I've tried to do this professionally by founding an EdTech company, and doing product design for an electric bicycle company. I've also had jobs in consulting and data analytics.</p>
    <p>Academically, I'm interested in the topic of complex systems, the psychology of habit and self-improvement, and how technology can help individuals better understand both these phenomena. In my free time, I love to write, play music, and cook with friends.
