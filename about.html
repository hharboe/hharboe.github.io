				<h1>Mission</h1>
				<p>In life and in design, I'm happiest when helping others reach their full potential. I enjoy building tools that educate and empower.
				</p>
				<h1>Background</h1>
				<p>Since graduating from <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/" target="_blank">Oberlin College</a> in 2015, I've been a <a href="https://tgggroup.com" target="_blank">behavioral economics consultant</a>, <a href="https://idassoc.com" target="_blank">product data analyst</a>, and product manager, researcher, and designer.</p>
				<p>Along the way, I founded an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160416025920/http://www.lumened.org:80/" target="_blank">edtech startup</a>, where I led design, marketing, and sales part-time from 2013-2015, and full-time in 2016.</p>
				<h1>Complex Systems</h1>
				<p>I attended my first <a href="http://necsi.edu/" target="_blank">NECSI workshop</a> in January, which hooked me on the growing field of <a href="http://www.necsi.edu/guide/points.html" target="_blank">Complex Systems Science</a>. A personal goal for 2018 is to better grasp the interdisciplinary methods of CSS, and apply them in my work.</p>
				<h1>Music</h1>
				<p>I wrote for an <a href="https://twitter.com/inyourspeakers" target="_blank">indie music magazine</a> in high school, and hosted an experimental radio show on <a href="https://www.wobc.org/info/about" target="_blank">WOBC 91.5 FM</a> for four years. I also record my own music, and post some of it on  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/henryharboe" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>.</p>
