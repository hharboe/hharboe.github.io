				<p>Hi, I’m Henry, a “product person” in Brooklyn, NY. My <a href="/work.html#other">background</a> is in design consulting, with an emphasis on research and information architecture. I also founded an <a href="/work.html#lumened">edtech startup</a>.</p>
				<p>&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left my consulting job one year ago to take on my first freelance product design <a href="/work.html#michael">contract</a>. Now, I’m looking to join a product team, where my background will be valuable, and I can learn from experienced user researchers and designers.</p>
				<p>&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can explore my <a href="/work.html">work</a>, browse my <a href="/journal.html">journal</a>, or read more about me below. Thanks for visiting!</p>

				<h2>MISSION</h2>
				<p>I've found I'm happiest when helping people become their best selves. I think this starts with access to relevant education, and high-leverage tools. I like my work to focus on this, at scale, whenever possible.</p>

				<h2>MUSIC</h2>
				<p>Music has always been big for me. I studied jazz piano, saxophone, and guitar from grade school through college, and hosted a radio show on <a href="https://www.wobc.org/info/about" target="_blank">WOBC</a> for four years. I still write and record new music; you can follow me on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/henryharboe" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>.</p>

				<h2>FOCUS</h2>
				<p>I always knew I loved the problems of product design, but it took years of course-correction as a founder, consultant, and now freelancer to understand where I best fit in.
				<p>&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a room of consultants, I’m advocating for end-users. In a room of engineers, I’m focusing on business objectives. Understanding <em>why</em> a product works, and <em>where</em> it should go next, is what really makes me tick.</p>
				<p>&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've never worked within a large product team, and I'm still unsure where I fit between design, research, and product management. That said, I've never been more excited to devote time to a craft.</p>

				<h2>FUN</h2>
				<p>I’m not always this serious! I love hanging out in NYC parks and delis. I've never purchased an avocado toast. I'd probably love to meet ya!</p>
