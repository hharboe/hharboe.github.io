				<p>Hey! I'm Henry, a Product Researcher and Designer, and musician in Brooklyn, NY.</p><br>

				<!-- <p>I love using data to understand and ship clever, impactful, and usable products.</p><br> -->
				<p>I'm <em>currently</em> looking to join a product team, in a full-time, research-driven role. The perfect fit would value qualitative and quantitative methods, in collaboration with other designers.</p><br>

				<h2>MISSION</h2>
				<p>I'm happiest when helping people become their best selves. In product design, this translates to building tools that educate, inform, and empower.</p>

				<h2>MUSIC</h2>
				<p>Music has always been big in my life. I used to write for an <a href="https://twitter.com/inyourspeakers" target="_blank">online music magazine</a>, and I hosted a radio show on <a href="https://www.wobc.org/info/about" target="_blank">WOBC 91.5 FM</a> for four years.<p></br>
					<p> I've played multiple instruments since I was a kid. You can follow my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/henryharboe" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, where I sometimes post new music.</p>
