            <h2>THREE YEARS OF EDTECH</h2>
            <p>LumenEd began on stage at a pitch competition in Ohio, where three college juniors held a cardboard box containing a projector connected to a Raspberry Pi. Three years later, we had shipped thirty units of <em>The Bright Orange Box</em>: a battery-powered smart projector designed for offline classrooms, and were re-enrolling classrooms across five countries for <em>Video Pen Pals</em>: a global education program for K-8 classrooms.</p>

            <h1>RESEARCH</h1>
    				<h2>WHY A PROJECTOR IN A CLASSROOM?</h2>
    				<p>LumenEd's inspiration came in 2013 from the growing culture of video-based education in the US, and the pervasive inaccessibility of online videos in underprivileged parts of the world. Our question was simple: how would offline classrooms take advantage of a media player, video camera, and internet connection?</p>

    				<!-- <p>If classrooms found this concept useful, we felt 2013's hardware landscape provided a prime opportunity for a solution.</p> -->
            <p>Using the latest microprocessors, LED-based projectors, and video cameras of 2013, we saw an opportunity to create a robust classroom hub for video creation and consumption. Our vision was to create an empowered network of disparate classrooms, discovering new subject matter and sharing their unique perspectives with the rest of the world.</p>

            <h2>PILOTING THE CONCEPT</h2>
            <p>In summer 2013, one of our co-founders brought a retail projector, preloaded with educational videos, to a few underresourced classrooms in New Delhi. We heard lots of enthusiasm for the concept from teachers and students.</p>

            <p>In winter 2014, we received $10k from social impact grants and a startup pitch competition that funded our travel and development costs. We set out to test two applications of our hardware: playing video content in Indian classrooms, and facilitating a video exchange program between classrooms.</p>

            <p>From the end of spring into summer 2014, much of our time was devoted to the design, assembly, and shipment of our BOB prototypes. We ran into numerous headaches throughout this process, teaching us that pursuing BOBs in the future would be best accomplished through a professional manufacturer. </p>
    				<p>Teachers' feedback on the BOB was positive, but we knew we couldn't sell the BOB directly to schools. Selling to the government would be a large undertaking, so we were in search for a sustainable hardware business model.</p>
    				<h3><b>CONCLUSION 2: <em>TEACHERS PREFER THEIR OWN CONTENT</em></b></h3>

          <div class = "copy">
            <p>We were unsure if teachers would be capable or motivated to find their own educational videos, so we made an attempt to pre-loading BOBs with a library of videos mapped to Indian educational standards.</p>
    				<p>We curated a <a>library of open-source videos</a>, and built a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igdEv8es-TA">simple app interface</a> teachers could use to browse content. Teachers appreciated the gesture, but we learned that they	 ultimately prefer finding and playing their own materials.</p>
    				<h3><b>CONCLUSION 3: <em>VIDEO EXCHANGES ARE A SUCCESS</em></b></h3>

            <p>We found three schools in the US willing to participate in a video exchange project with our Indian school partners. We helped these classrooms send video diaries to each other over three months, covering their lives at school, their local communities, and favorite cultural practices.</p>
    				<p>The concept was a success. Students on both sides of the exchange had wonderful experiences filming videos in their classrooms, and seeing videos from their new friends abroad. We learned that Indian classrooms needed hardware to participate, and US classrooms were enthusiastic enough to pay for the experience again.</p>
