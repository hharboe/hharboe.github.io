					<h2>PROTOTYPING THE CONCEPT</h2>
					<p>In fall 2017, Faraday Bicycles Inc. wanted to build a chatbot to integrate with their electric bikes. I was contracted to refine their initial concept, and design a visual prototype.</p>
					<h4>Requests</h4>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">
						<li>Design a chatbot character who is entertaining and brand-aligned</li>
						<!-- <li>Brainstorm hardware/software integration points</li> -->
						<li>Mockup interface components for customer support, and activity data visualizations</li>

					<h2>SCOPING THE BETA</h2>
					<h4>Refining goals</h4>
					<p>Our contract's initial goals felt ambitious, so I suggested we narrow our focus, and success metrics, with a "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWIJosey8nI">NUF" brainstorm</a>.</p>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">
						<li>Educate: Teach non-cylists to become capable riders</li>
						<li>Engage: Help frequent cyclists plan their rides</li>
						<li>Mobilize: Create a brand for cycling evangelists to rally behind</li>

					<h4>Defining success metrics</h4>
					<p>Despite the feasibility risks, our client chose to focus on <em>Motivation</em>, with a goal of helping users increase their cycling habits.</p>
					<p>To track progress, we would focus on <em>days per week cycled</em>, from 0–4 weeks after sign up. We would also ask users to periodically rate their <em>cycling confidence</em>.</P>

					<h1>RESEARCH</h1>
					<h2>GENERATIVE RESEARCH</h2>
					<p>My research included a literature review and user interviews. My literature review had two objectives:</p>
					<h4>Objectives</h4>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">
						<li>Identify problem(s) to focus on</li>
						<li>Refine demographic of target cyclists/non-cyclists</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Identifying problems</h4>
					<p>I read studies on new and irregular cyclists' behavior, and mapped common deterrents into three categories. I crossed-out problems that looked <em>unsolvable</em> by software.</p>
			 	</div>
				<div class = "fig-container-col img-med-big">

				<div class="copy">
					<p>Based on the literature, the most prevalent problems were out of our scope. Many <em>solvable</em> problems had existing solutions, including cycling education classes, and shops that fix bicycle equipment.</p>
					<p>I hoped to uncover <em>why</em> existing solutions weren't being utilized—perhaps many people face confounding deterrents, or local solutions are inaccessible.</p>
					<h4>Understanding demographics</h4>
					<p>Many studies categorize cyclists based on psychological qualities. One convincing <a href="http://web.pdx.edu/~jdill/Types_of_Cyclists_PSUWorkingPaper.pdf">Portland-based study</a> built a typology of cyclists based on rider <em>confidence</em> and <em>enthusiasm</em>.

				<div class="copy">
					<p>Using their study as an analogy for our target users, we decided to focus on the groups in blue, who lack the confidence or enthusiasm to adopt a regular cycling routine.</p>
					<h4>Applying a behavioral change model</h4>
					<p>With this focus on boosting confidence and enthusiasm, we found inspiration in a <a href="#">behavioral change model</a> popularized by Stanford’s Persuasive Technology Lab.</p>

					<h4>Asking open-ended questions</h4>
					<p>We spoke with 16 adults across a range of demographics, cities, and cycling aptitudes. Our discussion addressed past cycling experiences, and habits related to maintaining cycling routines.</p>
					<div class = "survey-container">

					<h4>Identifying a niche audience</h4>
					<p>Our interviews showed that our target demographic was smaller than expected. Their most common deterrents included <em>traffic fears</em>, <em>weather discomfort</em>, and <em>bike maintainance</em>. </p>
					<p>I constructed user personas to align our team on who and <em>who not</em> to design for. Having names and faces to point to was very helpful during the design process.</p>

					<h4>Comparing affordances</h4>

					<h2>GAMIFYING FEATURES</h2>
					<p>Throughout testing, users questioned the desirability of our features. Users called our cycling guide "uninteresting" and "incomplete." When asked if our chatbot was empowering towards fitness or commute goals, some intermediate cyclists said, "not at all."</p>
					<p>Our team decided to <em>"gamify"</em> our chatbot. This meant incorporating our existing features into activity- or education-based challenges, that users could progress through via chatbot interactions.</p>
					<h4>Collecting feedback</h4>
					<p>In a survey collecting feedback on game ideas, 25% of inexperienced riders, and 0% of experienced riders expressed any interest. One rider said, "I'm very happy already with <a href="https://www.strava.com/" target="_blank">Strava</a>, where I can set my own goals. I don't need someone inventing arbitrary tasks for me."</p>
					<p>Despite this negative response, my client asked us to continue to develop three cycling games in the last two months of our contract.</p>
					<h4>Designing around user goals</h3>
					<p>I wrote each game's logic and copy around users' cycling goals, and steps we recommended to achieve them. Our games included:</p>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">
						<li><em>Zero to One:</em> Transitioning from non-cyclist to regular cyclist</li>

						<li><em>Workplace Warrior:</em> Starting a bike-to-work commute routine

					<h4>Improving usability</h4>
					<p>Usability testing revealed users were frustrated by "walls of text," and didn't know "how far [they had] progressed" in each challenge. To address this, I added more frequent checkpoints, emojis to break-up text, and image cards for richer displays of data.</p>
					<p>We also made adjustments to onboarding, with a richer introduction of our chatbot character, and a step that automatically enrolls users in the challenge that best fits their profile.</p>

					<h1>IMPACT</h1>
					<h2>REFLECTING ON THE WORK</h2>
					<p>After launching, our biggest push for users resulted in a lackluster response. While disappointed, we were not overly surprised, as many users had expressed skepticism throughout our process.</p>
					<p>I have many thoughts on where our team made good decisions, and where different actions may have increased our chance of success.</p>
					<h4>Our strengths</h4>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">
						<li>Minimize friction of conversational navigation</li>
						<p>This project started as a product searching for a user base. I believe this particially clouded our team's decision-making throughout the project.</p>

					<h4>Our mistakes</h4>

					</ul>

					<p>This project started as a product searching for a user base. I believe this particially clouded our team's decision-making throughout the project. For example, when faced with low user interest, our efforts to course-correct were often directed towards modifying the initial vision, rather than exploring new concepts which may have better addressed user needs.</p>
					<p>In the future, I hope to give stronger pushback, and encourage more open-mindedness, whenever a client's product vision is particularly set in stone. As it relates to this project, considering platforms outside of chatbots and directions outside of broad, full-service motivation might have lead to a more successful solution.</p>
					<h3>PROBLEM SOLVING AT TOO BROAD A SCALE</h3>
					<p>I believe the scope of problems this project addressed was too broad. By focusing on full-service motivation, we were ignoring the details of users’ emotions and experiences within each step of the process. For example, <em>Challenges</em> were built on sound motivational tactics for cycling motivation as a whole, but failed to address micro-problems users face during the cycling educative process. As a result, our motivational triggers failed to be convincing.</p>
					<p>Were I to start this project again, I would pick a problem identified in our research phase, such as bicycle purchasing or commute planning, and use more research methods to understand it deeply. In-person research such as ride-alongs, shop-alongs, repair-alongs, could have uncovered rich insights that lead to more focused, and potentially successful solution.</p>
					<h3>LENGTHY DEVELOPMENT AND TEST SPRINTS</h3>
					<p>Our team designed and iterated hundreds of pieces of educational content and chatbot conversations during our development process. Rather than create a few artifacts for usability testing, we often created many more to test usability <em>and</em> functionality. I think this categorically slowed down our learning process, leading to fewer insights that came later than would be ideal.</p>
