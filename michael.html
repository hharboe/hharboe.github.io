					<h1>Michael: Cycling Assistant</h1>
		      <p>In November 2017, an <a href="https://www.faradaybikes.com">electric bicycle startup</a> hired me to design the interface and identity for a new chatbot concept.</p>
					<p>One month later, I was contracted to design a Beta version. I led research and design for 3 months, and collaborated with <a href="https://prakashpaudel.com" target = "_blank">one developer</a> and our <a href="https://medium.com/@tkreek" target="_blank">client/product manager</a>.</p>

          <h2>FIRST CONTRACT</h2>
					 <p>In fall 2017, Faraday Bicycles Inc. wanted to build a chatbot to integrate with their electric bicycles. I was contracted for two weeks to refine their concept of a “cycling companion chatbot," and design an accompanying visual prototype.</p>
					<h4>Requests</h4>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">
						<li>Design a character that's entertaining and brand-aligned</li>
						<li>Brainstorm hardware/software integration points</li>
						<li>Mockup interface components, including a customer support channel, and activity data visualizations</li>

					<h2>SECOND CONTRACT</h2>
					<h4>Refining goals</h4>
					<p>Our second contract's functional goals felt ambitious, given our resources. In the first meeting, I led a "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWIJosey8nI">NUF" brainstorm</a> to help refine our focus and define success metrics.</p>

					<ul class = "copy-ul">

					<h4>Defining success metrics</h4>
					<p>Despite the risk shown by our "NUF" brainstorm, my client decided to focus on the <em>Education</em> direction, hoping to convince new and irregular cyclists to adopt new cycling routines.</p>
					<p>We would ask <em>how many days/week users cycled</em>, at and up to 3 months after sign up, as a proxy for a users' cycling routine durability.</p>

					<p>We learned that the most prevalent problems were <em>unsolvable</em>, or out of our scope, and many <em>solvable</em> problems had existing solutions. For example, cities often have classes to teach riding skills and bicycle shops to fix equipment.</p>
					<p>I hoped to uncover <em>why</em> new and irregular cyclists didn't utilize existing solutions—perhaps they faced confounding deterrents, or their solutions were inaccessible.</p>
					<h4>Understanding rider types</h4>
					<p>Many studies categorize cyclists based on psychological qualities. One convincing <a href="http://web.pdx.edu/~jdill/Types_of_Cyclists_PSUWorkingPaper.pdf">Portland-based study</a> built a typology of cyclists based on rider <em>confidence</em> and <em>enthusiasm</em>.

					<p>Using their study as an analogy for our target users, we decided to focus on the groups in blue, who lack the confidence or enthusiasm to adopt a regular cycling routine.</p>
					<h4>Applying a behavioral change model</h4>
					<p>With this focus on boosting confidence and enthusiasm, we found inspiration in a <a href="#">behavioral change model</a> popularized by Stanford’s Persuasive Technology Lab.</p>

					<p>We spoke with 16 adults across a range of demographics, cities, and cycling aptitudes. Our discussion addressed past cycling experiences, and habits related to maintaining cycling routines.</p>
					<div class = "survey-container">
						<div class = "survey-card">

					<p>Our interviews showed that our target proportion of adults (those who face <em>only</em> solvable deterrents) was smaller than we expected. The most common deterrents they faced included <em>traffic fears</em>, <em>weather discomfort</em>, and <em>bike maintainance</em>. </p>
					<h4>Avoiding negative personas</h4>
					<p>After interviews, I constructed user personas to align our team on who and <em>who not</em> to design for. Pointing to names and faces was very helpful when discussing design decisions.</p>

						<h2>PIVOTING OUR SOLUTION</h2>
						<h4>Problem</h4>
						<p>During usability testing, users were questioning the desirability of our features. Our cycling guide was called "uninteresting" and "incomplete." When asked if our chatbot was empowering towards fitness or commute goals, intermediate cyclists said "not at all."</p>
						<h4>Solution</h4>
						<p>Our team decided to <em>"gamify"</em> our chatbot, through conversation-based games. This meant incorporating our existing features into activity- or education-based challenges related to cycling.</p>
						<!-- <h4>Goal</h4>
						<ul class = "copy-ul">
							<li>Use small, consecutive recommendations to guide users through long-term tasks</li>
							<li>Increase user motivation by adding process-oriented goals to existing features</li>
							<li>Add fun, engaging interactions with users' local environment through  API calls</li>
						</ul> -->
						<h4>Gauging interest with surveys</h4>
						<p>I distributed a <a href="www.surveymonkey.com">SurveyMonkey</a> survey asking for feedback on our game ideas. About 25% of inexperienced riders had interest in cycling challenges orchestrated by an app, and experienced riders were not at all interested. One experienced rider said, "I'm very happy already with Strava, where I can measure myself and set my own goals. I don't need someone else inventing arbitrary tasks for me."</p>
						<p>A broader, more disappointing piece of feedback was that less than 50% of inexperienced riders said were interested in changing their cycling behavior at all.  Despite this negative response, my client asked us to continue to develop three cycling games in the last two months of our contract.</p>
						<!-- <ol class = "copy-ol">
					 		<li style = "padding-bottom: 12px"><h3>Confident riders were uninterested</h3></li>
							 <p>Quote:<em>"I'm very happy already with Strava, where I can measure myself and set my own goals. I don't need someone else inventing arbitrary tasks for me."</em></p>
					 		<li><h3>Inexperienced riders were barely interested</h3>Under half of inexperienced riders said were interested in changing their cycling behavior, and even fewer said they would participate in challenges orchestrated by an app</li>
				 		</ol> -->
							<p>Despite the dreary feedback, my client asked us to continue to develop three cycling games in the last two months of our contract.</p>
						<h4>Designing around user goals</h3>
						<p>I wrote game logic and copy for each game. Each game's checkpoints were aimed at user goals and important tasks we identified during our research phase. Our games included:</p>
						<ul class = "copy-ul">

						<p>Early usability testing revealed that "less text," "more visual content," and "explanation of in-game progress" were helpful to keep users engaged over time. To address this, I incorporated more frequent checkpoints, more emojis to break-up walls of text, and more image-based cards for richer information.</p>

					<h3>ENROLLING USERS DURING ONBOARDING</h3>
					<p>Once our games were live, I added a simple onboarding process that asks users to self-select their persona type, and a game that best fits their cycling goals. I used this opportunity to also introduce our character, and recommend tools they may find useful.</p>

					<h2>OBSERVING LOW ENGAGEMENT</h2>
					<p>In our last two weeks, we made a big push for more users, but received a lackluster response from our cycling games. While disappointed, we were not overly surprised, based on the results of our latest survey, and plenty of skepticism we received throughout the development process.</p>
					<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cyclingcompanion">Michael: Cycling Companion</a> is now live on <a href="https://www.messenger.com">Facebook Messenger</a>, and I check-in regularly with my client to see how user engagement fluctuates. Ultimately, the product did not succeed at its goal of the motivating a high percentage of reluctant cyclists to start cycling. My client is now in contact with cycling manufacturers, and advocacy groups, where he (and I) hope its functionality may serve useful.</p>

					<h1>ASSESSING IMPACT</h1>
					<h2>REFLECTING ON THE WORK</h2>
					<p>As I reached the end of my six month contract, I had many ideas where  both I and our team could have made different decision to benefit the outcome of the project.</p>
					<h3>STARTING WITH A PRODUCT IN MIND</h3>
					<p>This project started as a product searching for a user base. I believe this particially clouded our team's decision-making throughout the project. For example, when faced with low user interest, our efforts to course-correct were often directed towards modifying the initial vision, rather than exploring new concepts which may have better addressed user needs.</p>
					<p>In the future, I hope to give stronger pushback, and encourage more open-mindedness, whenever a client's product vision is particularly set in stone. As it relates to this project, considering platforms outside of chatbots and directions outside of broad, full-service motivation might have lead to a more successful solution.</p>
					<h3>PROBLEM SOLVING AT TOO BROAD A SCALE</h3>
					<p>I believe the scope of problems this project addressed was too broad. By focusing on full-service motivation, we were ignoring the details of users’ emotions and experiences within each step of the process. For example, <em>Challenges</em> were built on sound motivational tactics for cycling motivation as a whole, but failed to address micro-problems users face during the cycling educative process. As a result, our motivational triggers failed to be convincing.</p>
					<p>Were I to start this project again, I would pick a problem identified in our research phase, such as bicycle purchasing or commute planning, and use more research methods to understand it deeply. In-person research such as ride-alongs, shop-alongs, repair-alongs, could have uncovered rich insights that lead to more focused, and potentially successful solution.</p>
					<h3>LENGTHY DEVELOPMENT AND TEST SPRINTS</h3>
					<p>Our team designed and iterated hundreds of pieces of educational content and chatbot conversations during our development process. Rather than create a few artifacts for usability testing, we often created many more to test usability <em>and</em> functionality. I think this categorically slowed down our learning process, leading to fewer insights that came later than would be ideal.</p>
