		      <h1>MICHAEL: CYCLING COMPANION</h1>
		      <p>In October 2017, I was contracted to design the UI and persona behind an electric bicycle startup’s new chatbot. The project soon became focused on educating and motivating users about cycling.</p>
					<h2>MY ROLE</h2>
					<p>I worked part-time for six months with one developer and our client, the product manager, to release a Beta version. As the sole designer, I was responsible for product scoping, research, design, and testing.</p>

          <h2>INITIAL CONCEPT</h2>
          <p>In fall 2017, Faraday Bicycles Inc. was exploring a new chatbot concept to help riders get more out of their electric bicycles. Thomas Kreek, an employee at Faraday, and past collaborator of mine, contracted me to build an early prototype behind their vision of a "cycling companion.”</p>
        </div>
				<div class = "fig-container">
					<figure class = "fig-container-col img-gif">
						<div>
							<img src = "/images2/michael/logo.gif">

						<figcaption>I chose to use the likeness of Michael Faraday, famous 19th century physicist and namesake of the company, as the chatbot persona</figcaption>

						<figcaption>My proof-of-concept prototype used Faraday brand colors and provided users a variety of activity tracking and bike integration features</figcaption>
				 	</figure>
				</div>
				<div class="copy">
					<p>Faraday decided to pass on the project, but Thomas was enthusiastic enough to continue on his own. In October 2017, he offered me and a developer 6-month part-time contracts to build a cycling chatbot, hoping to pitch the concept to Faraday later.</p>
					<h2>DEFINING OBJECTIVES</h2>
					<p>My client's vision was to build functionality straddling three goals:</p>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">
						<li>Education: Teach non-cylists to become capable riders</li>
						<li>Utility: Attract regular use from frequent cyclists</li>
						<li>Mascot: Create a brand cycling evangelists can rally behind</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Given our limited resources, I pushed to find one area to focus on. At the start of our contract, I lead a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/affinity-diagram/">“NUF”</a> (Novelty, Usefulness, Feasibility) brainstorming session to rank our potential directions.</p>

							<img src = "/images2/michael/NUF.png">
						</div>
				 	</figure>
			 	</div>
			 	<div class="copy">
				 	<p>Further discussions revealed that cycling education was my client's preferred direction forward. Throughout development, our target success metric would be <em>the percentage of reluctant cyclists who start riding</em> after using our chatbot.</p>

				<div class="copy">
					<h1>RESEARCH</h1>
				 	<h2>LITERATURE REVIEW</h2>
				 	<p>My research process began by breaking down the problem of "What motivates cycles?" into specific questions, and exploring those questions in existing literature.</p>
				 	<h3>1. WHICH CYCLISTS SHOULD WE TARGET?</h3>
				 	<p>There is a large body of work creating typologies of American cyclists. One interesting Portland study segmented adults into four categories, based on self-rated interest and confidence:</p>
				 	<ol class = "copy-ol">
					 	<li><em>Strong and Fearless:</em> &nbsp;Cyclists riding multiple times per week</li>
					 	<li><em>Enthused and Confident:</em> &nbsp;Cyclists eager to ride more</li>
					 	<li><em>Interested but Concerned:</em> &nbsp;Non-cyclists considering starting</li>
					 	<li><em>Reluctant to Cycle:</em> &nbsp;Non-cyclists facing irrevocable deterents</li></em>
				 	</ol>
				 	<p>We turned our focus to <em>Enthused and Confident</em>, cyclists who could use tools to plan or enjoy more rides, and <em>Interested but Concerned</em> non-cyclists, who need an extra nudge or lesson before starting.</p>
				 	<h3>2. WHICH PROBLEMS CAN WE ADDRESS?</h3>
				 	<p>While exploring factors of cycling motivation, I found many studies on cycling deterrents. Environmental barriers such as <em>hilly terrains</em>, <em>high-traffic density</em>, or <em>routes over 10km</em> are by far the most deterring. We decided early on that helping users bypass these environmental barriers would be out of scope.</p>
				 	<p>When environments are slightly more favorabe to cycling, research shows that <em>confidence,</em> <em>perceived benefits of cycling</em>, and <em>social support</em> can be the next-strongest factors to promote cycling. Focusing on these factors looked like our next-best approach.</p>
				 	<h3>3. WHAT IS OUR MODEL OF CYCLING MOTIVATION?</h3>
				 	<p>As I read more into studies of motivation and behavioral change, and found a model published by Stanford University’s Persuasive Technology Lab. This model served as inspiration for the educative process we would design for our target demographic.</p>
			 	</div>

				<div class="copy">
					<p>At the end of my literature review, we wrote our own model of what's required to start cycling regularly.</p>

			 	<div class="copy">
				 	<p>First, users had to find a purpose to cycle to renew their interest. Then, access to confidence-boosting tools would enable users to commit to the proces. Finally, motivational triggers would inspire behavioral change over time.</p>
				 	<h2>USER INTERVIEWS</h2>
				 	<p>To better understand the priorities in our target demographic, we spoke with 16 adults across a range of demographics, cities, and cycling aptitudes. We asked questions about recent cycling experiences, fitness and cycling goals, and priorities when making riding decisions.</p>

					<h2>TECH CONSTRAINTS</h2>
					<p>Before any prototyping, we had to decide whether we wanted to release our chatbot in a native app, or through a chatbot platform like Facebook Messenger or Slack. We opted to release on Facebook Messenger, partially because of its cross-device support and ubiquity, and partially due to our limited budget and timeline.</p>
				 	<h3>TWO-SIDED CONVERSATIONS</h3>
				 	<p>We found that Messenger offered a few unique chatbot affordances that would be helpful for our bootstrapping: Card Carousels and Quick Replies.</p>

				<div class="copy">
					<p><em>Card Carousels</em> and <em>Quick Replies</em> would allow us to write both sides of users' conversations. Traversing users through predetermined conversation paths would hopefully avoid most instances of misinterpretted user intent.</p>
					<h3>SUPPORTING FREE-TEXT QUERIES</h3>
					<p>Microsoft’s Bot Framework gave us access to LUIS, a natural language processing tool. LUIS would allow us to train a machine learning-based language model to interpret users’ messages and direct them to a particular chatbot function.</p>

					<h1>DESIGN</h1>
					<h2>CREATING A CHARACTER</h2>
					<p>My client was adamant about designing a rich character behind our chatbot’s messaging, in effort to inspire an emotional connection from our users. Keeping my original concept of Michael Faraday, I wrote guidelines for how our team should write conversation flows.</p>
				</div>
				<figure class = "fig-container-row">
					<div class="paragraph-container">
						<h3>1. MAINTAIN PERSONALITY</h3>
					 	<ul class = "copy-ul">
							<li>Write in-character with familiar language</li>
							<li>Avoid monotonous enthusiasm; excessive '!’s</li>
							<li>Avoid platitudes; emphasize factual statements</li>
						</ul>
						<h4><s>“Everyone can ride if the weather’s nice!”</s></h4>
						<h4>"Cycling in a t-shirt is comfortable above 70°.”</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="paragraph-container">
						<h3>2. BUILD USER CONFIDENCE</h3>
						<ul class = "copy-ul">
							<li>Treat users as if they're confident</li>
						 	<li>Ask users to one-up their presonal best</li>
						 	<li>Avoid vapid praise, recognize accomplishments</li>

				 		<h4><s>“Great job! You are doing amazing.”</s></h4>
				 		<h4>“21 miles cycled this week. How about 30 next week?”</h4>
			 		</div>
					<figcaption class = "single-caption">My full list of guidelines are published <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Dialogue-Style-Guide-nSx8XXsOCb9MGjDOXsorh">here</a>.</figcaption>
				</figure>
			 	<div class="copy">
					<p>My guidelines were inspired by a few books and articles on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12910715-designing-for-emotion">designing for emotion</a>, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/legibility-readability-comprehension/">writing for mobile interfaces</a>, and <a href-"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32758034-designing-bots">avoiding common pitfalls</a> of monotonous software characters.</p>
				 	<h2>ITERATING ON EDUCATIONAL CONTENT</h2>
				 	<p>The first educational content we worked on were <em>Knowledge Cards</em>, images providing bite-size motivational and confidence-boosting information on topics and tasks we identified were important or challenging for our users.</p>
			 	</div>
				<div class = "fig-container">
		 			<figure class = "fig-container-col img-gif">
			 			<div>
			 				<video autoplay muted controls loop class = "img-gif" src = "/vids/knowledge.mov">
			 			</div>
			 			<figcaption class = "multi-caption img-gif">Users could browse cards by topic after selecting “Cycling Guide” from our menu</figcaption>
		 			</figure>
				</div>
				<div class="copy">
			 		<p>Early usability testing revealed that non-cyclists felt intimidated when asked to explore cards by topic. One user said, <em>“This is hard for me to get through, because, to be honest, I’m not sure what I don’t know.”</em> Another user said, <em>“I can see how this would help people, but it’s too tedious for me.”</em></p>
			 		<p>I identified two problems with our current design based on feedback:</p>
			 		<ol class = "copy-ol">
				 		<li><em>Lack of context:</em> Knowledge Cards alone were not substantial enough to create a lasting effect on users’ confidence.</li>
				 		<li><em>Poor navigation:</em> Our navigation structure for Knowledge Cards did not match users’ mental models for learning</li>
			 		</ol>
			 		<h3>IMPROVING CONTEXT WITH SCENARIOS</h3>
			 		<p>To add substance to users' interaction with Knowledge Cards, we wrote conversational procedures that included multiple cards, calls to APIs, and even reminders to finish tasks. We mapped these procedures to complicated scenarios that single cards could not address on their own.</p>
		 		</div>
				<div class = "fig-container">

		 	 		</figure>
				</div>
		 		<div class="copy">
				 	<h3>ADHERING TO "Q&A" MENTAL MODELS</h3>
				 	<p>Our solution to the navigation problem was allowing users to interact with our Knowledge Cards in a question-and-answer format. Users would be able to ask unique questions from our chatbot, and our language model would map their question to the best-fitting card.</p>

					<h2>USING 'CHALLENGES' TO BOOST ENGAGEMENT</h2>
					<!-- <h3>ATTEMPTING TO BOOST USER ENGAGEMENT</h3> -->
					<p>Despite our efforts to craft emotional character interactions, and make discoverable/usable educational content, users still weren't swayed to use Michael regularly. This was understandable—chatbots are still unfamiliar to many, and our cycling educational content was not necessarily attention-grabbing.</p>
					<p> With intentions to increase user engagement, our team considered writing text-based, educational games around our existing features. The vision was to provide users with end-to-end guidance along real-world goals, e.g. learning to cycle in traffic, or commuting to work.</p>
					<h3>GAUGING INTEREST WITH SURVEYS</h3>
					<p>I distributed <a href="www.surveymonkey.com">SurveyMonkey</a> survey asking users to provide feedback on our initial game concepts. We received a ranking of concepts, suggesting a feasible product roadmap, but most users were underwhelmed by the concept overall.</p>
					<p>Frequent, confident riders had the most negative feedback, including, <em>"I'm very happy already with Strava, where I can measure myself and set my own goals. I don't need someone else inventing arbitrary tasks for me."</em>Under half of inexperienced riders said were interested in changing their cycling behavior, and even fewer said they would participate in challenges orchestrated by an app.
						<p>Despite the dreary feedback, my client asked us to continue to develop three cycling games in the last two months of our contract.</p>
					<h3>GAMIFYING <em>MOTIVATION</em> TASKS AND USER GOALS</h3>
					<p> After identifying the most popular concepts for our user base, and checking them against our list of motivational tasks and persona goals, I wrote outlines for three games our chatbot could support.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "fig-container">
					<figure class = "fig-container-col img-med-big">

					</figure>
				</div>
				<div class="copy">
					<p>I wrote game logic and copy for each game, while my developer started coding. Designing, developing, and shipping three games took over a month to complete. Our three games were:</p>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">
						<li><em>Zero to One:</em> Transitioning from non-cyclist to regular cyclist</li>
						<li><em>Marco Polo:</em> Setting goals to bike to local attractions</li>
						<li><em>Workplace Warrior:</em> Setting goals for bike-to-work commutes
					</ul>

				</div>
				<!-- <div class="copy">
					<h3>ENROLLING USERS DURING ONBOARDING</h3>
					<p>Once our games were live, I added a simple onboarding process that asks users to self-select their persona type, and a game that best fits their cycling goals. I used this opportunity to also introduce our character, and recommend tools they may find useful.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "fig-container">

	 				</figure>
				</div> -->
				<div class="copy">
					<p>Testing games was a continuous and time-intensive iterative process. Early usability testing revealed that <em>less text</em>, <em>more bullets and visual content</em>, and <em>regular communication of in-game progress</em> was helpful and motivating to stay engaged over time.</p>
					<h3>OBSERVING LOW USER ENGAGEMENT</h3>
					<p>In our last two weeks, we made a big push for more users, but received a lackluster response from our cycling games. While disappointed, we were not overly surprised, based on the results of our latest survey, and plenty of skepticism we received throughout the development process.</p>
					<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cyclingcompanion">Michael: Cycling Companion</a> is now live on <a href="https://www.messenger.com">Facebook Messenger</a>, and I check-in regularly with my client to see how user engagement fluctuates. Ultimately, the product did not succeed at its goal of the motivating a high percentage of reluctant cyclists to start cycling. My client is now in contact with cycling manufacturers, and advocacy groups, where he (and I) hope its functionality may serve useful.</p>

					<h1>ASSESSING IMPACT</h1>
					<h2>REFLECTING ON THE WORK</h2>
					<p>As I reached the end of my six month contract, I had many ideas where  both I and our team could have made different decision to benefit the outcome of the project.</p>
					<h3>STARTING WITH A PRODUCT IN MIND</h3>
					<p>This project started as a product searching for a user base. I believe this particially clouded our team's decision-making throughout the project. For example, when faced with low user interest, our efforts to course-correct were often directed towards modifying the initial vision, rather than exploring new concepts which may have better addressed user needs.</p>
					<p>In the future, I hope to give stronger pushback, and encourage more open-mindedness, whenever a client's product vision is particularly set in stone. As it relates to this project, considering platforms outside of chatbots and directions outside of broad, full-service motivation might have lead to a more successful solution.</p>
					<h3>PROBLEM SOLVING AT TOO BROAD A SCALE</h3>
					<p>I believe the scope of problems this project addressed was too broad. By focusing on full-service motivation, we were ignoring the details of users’ emotions and experiences within each step of the process. For example, <em>Challenges</em> were built on sound motivational tactics for cycling motivation as a whole, but failed to address micro-problems users face during the cycling educative process. As a result, our motivational triggers failed to be convincing.</p>
					<p>Were I to start this project again, I would pick a problem identified in our research phase, such as bicycle purchasing or commute planning, and use more research methods to understand it deeply. In-person research such as ride-alongs, shop-alongs, repair-alongs, could have uncovered rich insights that lead to more focused, and potentially successful solution.</p>
					<h3>LENGTHY DEVELOPMENT AND TEST SPRINTS</h3>
					<p>Our team designed and iterated hundreds of pieces of educational content and chatbot conversations during our development process. Rather than create a few artifacts for usability testing, we often created many more to test usability <em>and</em> functionality. I think this categorically slowed down our learning process, leading to fewer insights that came later than would be ideal.</p>
