					<h1>Michael: Cycling Assistant</h1>
					<p>In late 2017, <a href="https://www.faradaybikes.com">Faraday Bicycles</a> was searching for new way to share the value of electric bicycles with their target market. They decided to build the first "cycling chatbot"—a tool for accessing practical cycling information, activity data, and local recommendations.</p>
					<h2>My Role</h2>
					<p>I was contracted to design a functional Beta around this idea. I collaborated with <a href="https://prakashpaudel.com" target = "_blank">one freelance developer</a>, and one Faraday manager, who led us through a four month development process.</p>
					<p>My responsibilities included:</p>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">
						<li>Helping define the project's scope</li>
						<li>Leading generative research</li>
						<li>Leading feature design and copywriting</li>

					<h2>CONCEPT PROTOTYPING</h2>
					<p>My first task was to design a visual prototype around my client's vision for a "cycling companion chatbot."</p>
					<h4>Requests</h4>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">

					<p>After approving the project, Faraday decided to pivot away from integrating with electric bikes, and focus on building an information hub for all types of cyclists.</p>
					<h2>TRIMMING SCOPE</h2>
					<!-- <p>Faraday had three objectives for their chatbot: to motivate new and infrequent riders, to engage frequent riders, and to help cycling evangelist groups rally their members.</p> -->
					<p>Faraday had three objectives for their chatbot:</p>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">
						<li>Motivate non-cyclists to start biking</li>
						<li>Engage infrequent cyclists to ride more</li>
						<li>Help cycling evangelist groups rally their members</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Pursuing all three goals felt ambitious for our small team, so I recommended we pick one <a href="">North Star</a> objective to pursue deeply.</p>
					<h4>Weighing complexity</h4>
					<p>In our first client meeting, I led a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWIJosey8nI">"NUF" brainstorm</a> to evaluate the merits and complexity of each idea.</p>

					<p>The "NUF" analysis clarified that each goal would be challenging to achieve. Succeeding at all three would be far beyond our budget.</p>
					<h4>Expanding on opportunities</h4>
					<p>After agreeing to limit our scope, our team began developing an <a href="https://www.producttalk.org/2016/08/opportunity-solution-tree/">Opportunity-Solution Tree</a> to identify which objective had the most promising opportunities.</p>
					<p>We <a href="https://www.producttalk.org/2014/02/stop-brainstorming-and-generate-better-ideas/">individually brainstormed</a> opportunities and solutions under each objective, and came together to evaluate our ideas.</p>

					<h1>DISCOVERY</h1>
					<h2>REVIEWING LITERATURE</h2>
					<p>In preparation for user interviews, I spent some time looking for existing studies on cyclists' behavior, goals, and challenges.</p>
					<h4>Differentiating users</h4>
					<p>Few studies prioritize cyclist <a href="https://jtbd.info/yes-personas-focus-on-demographics-and-how-to-fix-that-f27c02498e9d">goals over demographics</a>, but one <a href="http://web.pdx.edu/~jdill/Types_of_Cyclists_PSUWorkingPaper.pdf"> Portland-based study</a>  found a strong correlation between goals and two psychological factors: <em>cycling confidence</em> and <em>enthusiasm</em>.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "fig-container">
					<figure class = "fig-container-col img-med-big">
						<div>
							<img src = "/images/michael/typology.png">
						</div>
						<figcaption>Nearly all of the study's sample population fit into one of the four categories above. "Strong and Fearless" adults cycled the most, followed by "Interested and Confident" adults</figcaption>
				 	</figure>
				</div>
				<div class="copy">
					<p>In our upcoming user interviews, we hoped this framework would provide a helpful starting point to segmenting users by goals.</p>
					<h4>Previewing a solution</h4>
					<p>Before moving on, it felt relevant for our team to discuss BJ Fogg's <a href="#">behavioral change model</a>, which emphasizes the importance of <em>ability</em> and <em>motivation</em> (similar to confidence and enthusiasm).</p>
				</div>
 				<div class = "fig-container">
 				 	<figure class = "fig-container-col img-med">
 					 	<div>

 					 	<figcaption class = "single-caption">BJ Fogg’s model shows that when Motivation and Ability are high, Triggers can impact a person's behavior</figcaption>
 				 	</figure>
 				</div>
 				<div class="copy">
 					<p>We felt this model could inspire how our chatbot motivated users. We hoped interviews might identify factors of <em>confidence/ability</em>, <em>enthusiasm/motivation</em>, and <em>triggers</em> prioritized by our audience.</p>
					<h2>INTERVIEWING CYCLISTS</h2>
					<p>We spoke with 9 adults in our target segment, and 7 in the <em>No Way, No How</em> or <em>Strong and Fearless</em> segments. We asked open-ended questions about past experiences and current behaviors related to cycling and commuting.</p>
					<div class = "survey-container">
						<div class = "survey-card">
							<h3>Who we spoke with:</h3>

					</div>
						<figcaption>Examples of questions from our interviews</figcaption>
					<!-- <h4>Result #1: Few cycling goals</h4> -->
					<h4>Exploring user goals</h4>
					<!-- <p>When asking about transportation goals, we split "transportation" into <em>work commutes</em>, and <em>other trips</em>. -->
					<h3>Hard to inspire non-interested commuters to adopt cycling</h3>
					<p>"Excessive time spent" was the most common frustration we heard related to commuting by car and public transit. Mentions of "discomfort" and "lack of physical activity" were in the minority, with almost no mention of financial or environmental costs.</p>sa
					<p>"Lack of opportunities" was the most common deterrent we heard for cycling, with "fear of traffic" and "difficulty/discomfort" closely following for users with low self-rated confidence.</p>
					<p>Our challenge was that cycling would not solve the issues of "time spent" or "discomfort" for most users. "Lack of opportunities" and "fear of traffic" were mostly out of the range of our impact, aside from recommendations or tips.</p>
					<p>We couldn't solve problems for users with low enthusiasm, and we could only partially solve problems or users with low confidence/high enthusiasm.</p>
					<p>The problem space was not focused on one thing. Amalgam of confounding issues. We could either try to address one, try to focus on a few, or try to switch to a different opportunity. I left my client to decide.</p>
					<p>We decided to focus on a few, with an emphasis on "fun" to make the app engaging despite a lack of problem-solution match.</p>
					<p>I constructed user personas to align our team on who and <em>who not</em> to design for. Having characters to point to was very helpful during the design process.</p>

					<h2>GAMIFYING FEATURES</h2>
					<p>Throughout testing, users questioned the helpfulness of our features, calling our cycling guide "uninteresting" or "incomplete." Others said they felt not at all empowered to pursue new habits.</p>
					<p>Our team decided to <em>gamify</em> our chatbot, by adding process-oriented motivation into existing features. New activity- or education-based <em>challenges</em> could be progressed-through via chatbot interactions.</p>
					<h4>Collecting feedback</h4>
					<p>25% of inexperienced riders, and 0% of experienced riders, expressed interest in our challenges idea. One rider said, "I'm happy with <a href="https://www.strava.com/" target="_blank">Strava</a>, where I set my own goals. I don't need more arbitrary tasks."</p>
					<p>Despite this negative response, my client asked us to continue to develop three cycling games in the last two months of our contract.</p>
					<h4>Designing around user goals</h3>
					<p>I wrote each challenge's logic and copy around steps to achieve cycling-related goals. Our challenges included:</p>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">
						<li><em>Zero to One:</em> Transitioning from non-cyclist to regular cyclist</li>

					<h1>IMPACT</h1>
					<h2>LOW ENGAGEMENT</h2>
					<p>After launching, our biggest push for users resulted in a lackluster response. While disappointed, we were not overly surprised, as many users had expressed skepticism throughout our process.</p>
					<p>I still check-in regularly with my client to hear how engagement is fluctuating, and if there are any updates planned. My client is now contacting bicycle manufacturers and advocacy groups, where he hopes our work can add value.</p>
					<h2>POST-WORK REFLECTIONS</h2>
					<p>I have many thoughts on where our team made good decisions, and where different actions may have increased our chance of success.</p>
					<h4>Insights on product design</h4>
					<ol class = "copy-ol">
						<li><h3>A product spec without a use case leads to inefficient design</h3></li>
						<ul class = "copy-ul">
							<li>Pressure to satisfy the initial vision distracts the design process from course-correcting</li>
							<li>Too many initial constraints stifle opportunities to experiment</li>
						</ul>
						<li><h3>Motivational content, on its own, results in low engagement</h3></li>
						<ul class = "copy-ul">
							<li>Motivational content engages users less than content that is entertaining, or solves a user's problem</li>
							<li>A motivational service must also address hurdles facing users, before expecting a change in behavior</li>
						</ul>
						<li><h3>Solutions aimed at too broad a problem will overlook critical opportunities to add value</h3></li>
						<ul class = "copy-ul" style = "padding-bottom: 8px">
							<li>Solutions designed for broad problems may fail to address the most crucial hurdles in users' experiences</li>
							<li>Addressing many problems at once results many poor solutions</li>
							<li>Expanding on one proven solution is simpler than searching for value in a broad, unproven solution</li>
						</ul>
					</ol>
					<h4>Insights on chatbots</h4>
					<ol class = "copy-ol">
						<li><h3>Chatbots work best in short-form, functional interactions</h3></li>
						<ul class = "copy-ul">
							<li>Reading and responding to a chatbot increases time spent engaging with content, and limits opportunities to skim content</li>
							<li>A conversational approach to content engagement may lead to better retention, or interruptions in comprehension (unclear)</li>
						</ul>
						<li><h3>Authoring a humanoid chatbot is best done algorithmically</h3></li>
						<ul class = "copy-ul" style = "padding-bottom: 8px">
							<li>Human interactions are character-driven, empathetic, highly variable, and hard to imitate</li>
							<li>Imitating human conversations is tedious for chatbot authors, and <em>believability</em>, as a target, is abstract</li>
							<li>A lack of writing time leads most chatbots to include drab, hyper-functional, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley" target="_blank">uncanny</a> language</li>
							<li>Scaling copywriting for a humanoid chatbot likely requires an automated, algorithmic approach</li>
						</ul>
					</ol>
					<h4>Future recommendations to self</h4>
						<ul class = "copy-ul">
							<li>Give more pushback when the product spec lacks a use case</li>
							<li>Shorten prototype-and-test cycles (we should have aimed for 2 week cycles, not 3, and never 4) to find the most impactful problem/solution more quickly</li>
							<li>Grade usability tests on a rubric, tracking variables over time</li>
							<li>Reduce scope of target problem. For example, instead of focusing on “educating non-cyclists,” focus on a tangible problem, like "most adults find routine bike maintenance inconvenient”</li>
							<li>Spend more time understanding a single problem with high-touch methods. For example, to research cycling maintenance, go on ride-alongs, <em>repair-alongs</em>, and <em>shop-alongs</em></li>
						</ul>
