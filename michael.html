          <h2>INITIAL CONTRACT</h2>
					 <p>In fall 2017, Faraday Bicycles Inc. was exploring a new chatbot concept to integrate with their electric bicycles. I was contracted to build a prototype behind their vision of a “cycling companion.”</p>
					<h4>Requests</h4>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">
						<li>Create a compelling chatbot identity</li>
						<li>Include a channel for customer support</li>
						<li>Mockup data visualizations to display rider/bicycle activity</li>
						<li>Brainstorm integration points between app and bicycle</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Result</h4>

				</div>
				<div class="copy">
					<!-- <h4>Results</h4> -->
					<p>Faraday opted to pass the project, but one employee, Thomas Kreek, was enthusiastic enough to continue on his own. He offered me and a developer contracts to build-out a functional Beta for the chatbot.</p>

					<h2>EXTENDED CONTRACT</h2>
					<p>Thomas had new goals for the chatbot, which were ambitious, given our limited resources. I helped refine our focus by leading a "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWIJosey8nI">NUF</a>" brainstorming session, and identifying success metrics.</p>
					<h4>Functional Goals</h4>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">
						<li>Educate: Teach non-cylists to become capable riders</li>
						<li>Engage: Attract regular use from frequent cyclists</li>
						<li>Mobilize: Create a brand for cycling evangelists to rally behind</li>
					</ul>
					<!-- <h4>Goal refinement</h4> -->
					<p>Our "NUF" brainstorming revealed that all three goals would be hard to achieve. Despite this risk, my client decided to direct our work towards the <em>Education</em> goal of the product.</p>

						</div>
				 	</figure>
			 	</div>
			 	<div class="copy">
					<h4>Defining success metrics</h4>
					<p>With this task at hand, I guided my client through brainstorming success metrics, to judge our progress.</p>
					<ol class = "copy-ol">
						<li>Ask Beta users to rate their <em>confidence</em> and <em>motivation</em> to cycle, before and after using our chatbot</li>
						<li>Focus on the <em>percentage of adults who start cycling after using the chatbot</em>, as an overall metric for success</li>

					<h1>RESEARCH</h1>
					<h2>PLANNING</h2>
					<p>I advocated for upfront research to guide our product roadmap. My research plan included a literature review to understand broad pain points in cycling, and user interviews to fill-in the details of rider profiles and their preferences.</p>
				 	<h2>LITERATURE REVIEW</h2>
					<h4>Goals</h4>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">
						<li>Narrow our target demographic</li>
						<li>Find a problem area addressed by education/motivation</li>
						<li>Inform a questionnaire to present in upcoming interviews</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Narrowing user type</h4>
					<p>Many studies find that confidence, perceived benefits, and social support are the strongest positive indicators of cycling activity. With this in mind, I was inspired by a <a href="http://web.pdx.edu/~jdill/Types_of_Cyclists_PSUWorkingPaper.pdf">Portland-based study</a>, which built a typology of cyclists based on rider confidence and enthusiasm.

						<div>
							<img src = "/images2/michael/typology.png">

						<figcaption>Nearly all of the sampled population fit clearly into one of the four categories above. "Strong and Fearless" adults cycled the most, followed by "Interested and Confident" adults</figcaption>
				 	</figure>
				</div>
				<div class="copy">
					<p>"Strong and Fearless" and "No Way, No How" adults would be out of our scope, as they cycled regularly, or faced barriers we could not solve. Our focus would be on the two other groups (in blue, above).</p>
					<h4>Modeling behavioral change</h4>
					<p>Focusing on users' confidence and enthusiasm would allow us to design around a <a href="#">popular model of behavioral change</a>, published by Stanford University’s Persuasive Technology Lab.</p>
 			 	</div>
 				<div class = "fig-container">

 				 	</figure>
 				</div>
 				<div class="copy">
 					<p>This model served as the foundation for our chatbot's educative process. Further research would identify aspects of Ability, Motivation, and Triggers most important to our target demographic.</p>
					<h4>Filtering out deterrents</h4>
					<p>In addition to boosting confidence and motivation, I hoped to find ways to <em>problem-solve</em> for our users. I began studying cycling deterrents, using affinity mapping create three categories. I also called out deterrents that seemed "unsolvable" by software.</p>
			 	</div>

					<p>Many "solvable" deterrents had existing solutions, such as cycling education classes, and local bicycle shops. I hoped user interviews would uncover <em>why</em> our target demographic wasn't taking advantage of these solutions—perhaps multiple deterrents were confounding, or there were problems of accessibilty, cost, or quality.</p>
					<h2>USER INTERVIEWS</h2>
					<h4>Goals</h4>
					<ul class = "copy-ul">
						<li>Understand relationships between common cycling deterrents</li>
						<li>Identify tasks crucial to our demographic, but difficult to achieve</li>
						<!-- <li>Understand similarities in our two user groups</li> -->
					</ul>
					<h4>Asking open questions</h4>
					<p>We spoke with 16 adults across a range of demographics, cities, and cycling aptitudes. We discussed several topics, including past cycling experiences, and considerations when starting a cycling routine.</p>
					<div class = "survey-container" style= "padding-top: 0">
						<div class = "survey-card">
							<h3>Topic 1: Location & Deterrents</h3>
							<h5>"Have you biked in your current neighborhood? Why or why not?"</h5>
							<h5>"When and where have you ever biked for transportation?"</h5>
						</div>
						<div class = "survey-card">
						<h3>Topic 2: Bicycles & Maintenance</h3>
							<h5>"How has your bicycle’s condition kept you from cycling in the past?"</h5>
							<h5>"How would you describe your local bicycle shop?"</h5>
						</div>
						<div class = "survey-card">
							<h3>Topic 3: Benefits</h3>
							<h5>"How would cycling add or detract from your daily routine?"</h5>
							<h5>What do you enjoy most about biking?</h5>
						</div>
					</div>
						<figcaption>Examples of questions from our interviews</figcaption>
					<h4>Identifying our niche audience</h4>
					<p>Many respondents mentioned unsolvable deterrents as their primary reason for not cycling, leading us to believe "No Way, No How" cyclists were larger than we thought.</p>
					<p>The remaining users mentioned traffic fears, weather discomfort, and equipment maintainance moreso than unsolvable deterrents. We concluded our approach to confidence- and motivation-building would fit this niche audience.</p>
					<h2>CONSOLIDATING RESEARCH</h2>
					<p>The last step of my research process was drawing connections from findings to a psuedo-product roadmap.
						<h4>Designing around tasks</h4>
						<p>I compiled a list of tasks respondents said were both crucial to cycling regularly, and difficult to achieve. These tasks would guide the confidence-building and motivating features I would prototype in our design phase.</p>

					<h4>Avoiding negative personas</h4>
					<p>I also constructed a few user personas. My goal was to keep our team aligned on who we were not building for, just as much as who we were building for. Pointing to names of individual proved very helpful in our upcoming design process.</p>

					<h4>Documenting constraints</h4>
					<p>We had a few explicit and generalized constraints to keep in mind after selecting Messenger as our platform:</p>

						<li style="padding-bottom: 12px">Character limits and layout restrictions of card templates</li>
						<!-- <li style="padding-bottom: 12px">Aspect ratios of cropped thumbnails and full-screen images</li> -->

						<li style="padding-bottom: 12px">Absence of traditional onboarding process to explain functionality</li>
						<li style="padding-bottom: 12px">Brevity required for a chat-based, mobile UI</li>

						<!-- <li style="padding-bottom: 12px">Avoiding robotic and buggy conversational elements common to most chatbots</li> -->
						<!-- <li style="padding-bottom: 12px"><em>Hard constraints</em> included adhering to character-count and UI restrictions within Messenger card templates, and to aspect ratio restrictions for images.</li>
						<li style="padding-bottom: 12px"><em>Soft constraints</em> included writing concisely for the conversational UI, providing text-based navigation in place of navigation buttons or menu bars, and avoiding many common chatbot pitfalls.</li> -->
						<!-- <li style="padding-bottom: 12px"><em>One additional client request</em>: use my <a href="/#refinement">original character design</a> for Michael Faraday, and attempt to write engaging copy that builds an emotional connection with users</li> -->
					</ul>
					<h2>DESIGNING A CHARACTER</h2>

						<p>I wrote game logic and copy for each game. Each game's checkpoints were aimed at user goals and important tasks we identified during our research phase. Our games included:</p>
						<ul class = "copy-ul">
							<li><em>Zero to One:</em> Transitioning from non-cyclist to regular cyclist</li>
							<li><em>Marco Polo:</em> Setting goals to bike to local attractions</li>
							<li><em>Workplace Warrior:</em> Setting goals for bike-to-work commutes
						</ul></p>

					<h2>OBSERVING LOW ENGAGEMENT</h2>
					<p>In our last two weeks, we made a big push for more users, but received a lackluster response from our cycling games. While disappointed, we were not overly surprised, based on the results of our latest survey, and plenty of skepticism we received throughout the development process.</p>
					<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cyclingcompanion">Michael: Cycling Companion</a> is now live on <a href="https://www.messenger.com">Facebook Messenger</a>, and I check-in regularly with my client to see how user engagement fluctuates. Ultimately, the product did not succeed at its goal of the motivating a high percentage of reluctant cyclists to start cycling. My client is now in contact with cycling manufacturers, and advocacy groups, where he (and I) hope its functionality may serve useful.</p>

					<h1>ASSESSING IMPACT</h1>
					<h2>REFLECTING ON THE WORK</h2>
					<p>As I reached the end of my six month contract, I had many ideas where  both I and our team could have made different decision to benefit the outcome of the project.</p>
					<h3>STARTING WITH A PRODUCT IN MIND</h3>
					<p>This project started as a product searching for a user base. I believe this particially clouded our team's decision-making throughout the project. For example, when faced with low user interest, our efforts to course-correct were often directed towards modifying the initial vision, rather than exploring new concepts which may have better addressed user needs.</p>
					<p>In the future, I hope to give stronger pushback, and encourage more open-mindedness, whenever a client's product vision is particularly set in stone. As it relates to this project, considering platforms outside of chatbots and directions outside of broad, full-service motivation might have lead to a more successful solution.</p>
					<h3>PROBLEM SOLVING AT TOO BROAD A SCALE</h3>
					<p>I believe the scope of problems this project addressed was too broad. By focusing on full-service motivation, we were ignoring the details of users’ emotions and experiences within each step of the process. For example, <em>Challenges</em> were built on sound motivational tactics for cycling motivation as a whole, but failed to address micro-problems users face during the cycling educative process. As a result, our motivational triggers failed to be convincing.</p>
					<p>Were I to start this project again, I would pick a problem identified in our research phase, such as bicycle purchasing or commute planning, and use more research methods to understand it deeply. In-person research such as ride-alongs, shop-alongs, repair-alongs, could have uncovered rich insights that lead to more focused, and potentially successful solution.</p>
					<h3>LENGTHY DEVELOPMENT AND TEST SPRINTS</h3>
					<p>Our team designed and iterated hundreds of pieces of educational content and chatbot conversations during our development process. Rather than create a few artifacts for usability testing, we often created many more to test usability <em>and</em> functionality. I think this categorically slowed down our learning process, leading to fewer insights that came later than would be ideal.</p>
