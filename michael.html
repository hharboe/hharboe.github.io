	      <h1>MICHAEL: CYCLING COMPANION</h1>
	      <p>In October 2017, a friend contracted me to prototype and pitch a chatbot to his employer, an electric bike startup in San Francisco. This is the story of how I helped create a software companion to urban cyclists.</p></section>
			<section class="role end">
				<h1>MY ROLE</h1>
				<p>I was responsible for the experience strategy of the chatbot, from preliminary research through beta testing. I also designed the character, conversation scheme, and all visual components within the chatbot interface.</p>
				<p>Development in Microsoft’s bot framework was lead by <a href="http://prakashpaudel.com">Prakash Paudel</a> with help from <a href="https://medium.com/@tkreek">Thomas Kreek</a>.</p></section>
			<section class="light">
			  <h1>BACKSTORY</h1>
			  <h2>OF BICYCLES AND CHATBOTS</h2>
				<p>In fall 2017, my <a href="/lumened.html">past collaborator</a>, Thomas Kreek, started developing a chatbot for his employer, electric bike startup, Faraday Bicycles. Their intentions were to build a chatbot that increased customer engagement, and brought more attention to Faraday’s brand in the cycling and tech communities.</p>
				<p>Faraday contracted me to build a prototype around this concept. With their brand styleguides in hand, I went to work creating a character and iOS interface around the concept of “cycling companion.” I borrowed the likeness of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday">Michael Faraday</a>, famous 19th century physicist (and namesake of the company), as the chatbot character providing tools to cyclists.</p></section>

			<section class="light end" id="row5">
				<p>Faraday decided to pass on the project, but Thomas was enthusiastic enough to continue on his own. The vision was to create a motivational and helpful chatbot around cycling—a tool to educate and inspire cyclists, and a mascot cycling evangelists could rally behind.</p>

				<p>In October 2017, he offered me and a developer friend contracts to build out a Beta version. Inspired by the mission and challenge, I accepted the contract and started planning the next 6-months. I hoped to guide our team along a design thinking process as much as possible.</p>

				<h1>LITERATURE REVIEW</h1>
				<h2>WHAT MOTIVATES CYCLISTS?</h2>
				<p>I began with a literature review with hopes to uncover documented factors leading non-cyclists to become active cyclists. While I found no causal claims about changes in cycling behavior, there were many studies on environmental and personal qualities favorable to urban cycling for transportation.</p>
				<p>I started by compiling a list of common deterrents to cycling, separating hard deterrents from those easier to overcome. Our team quickly made the decision that our software wouldn't be able to help users bypass these "hard" environmental and personal deterrents.</p>
			</section>
			<figure class="data-figure">
					<h3>HARD DETERRENTS TO CYCLING</h3>
				<div class="data-container">
					<div class ="data-details"><h4>ENVIRONMENTAL</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Lives near steep hills</li>
							<li>Relies on highways for most trips</li>
							<li>Travels more than 10 km for most trips</li>
							<li>Lives near high-traffic, poor cycling infrastructure</li>
						</ul></div>
					<div class ="data-details"><h4>PERSONAL</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Unable to cycle due to injury, illness or age</li>
							<li>Has personal distate for cycling or cyclists</li>
							<li>Must travel by car (kids, hauling, etc.)</li>
							<li>Rates comfort as highest commute concern</li>
						</ul></div></figure>
			<section class = "dark">
				<p>With more research, we learned that some environmental barrers are regularly ignored by cyclists. These "soft” environmental barriers, such as manageable traffic, small elevation changes, or commute distances under 10 km, are regularly overcome by individuals who exhibit two traits: <em>high cycling confidence</em>, and <em>high personal or social motivation to cycle.</em></p>
				<p>Building up cycling confidence and motivation seemed like a more achieveble direction for our chatbot to take. After reading more about this topic of <em>cycling self-efficacy</em>, I compiled a list of personal barriers to confidence and motivation. These were characteristics and events we would consider helping users surpass.</p></section>
			<figure class="data-figure">
				<h3>DETERRENTS TO CYCLING SELF-EFFICACY</h3>
				<div class="data-container">
					<div class ="data-details"><h4>LOW CONFIDENCE</h4>
						<ul>
							<li> Negative prior experiences cycling</li>
							<li>No cycling ability or knowledge of rules</li>
							<li>No knowledge of local cycling infrastructure</li>
							<li>Lack of functional cycling equipment</li>
						</ul></div>
					<div class ="data-details"><h4>LOW ENTHUSIASM</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Lifestyle allows little time or energy to cycle</li>
							<li>Enjoys current transportation options</li>
							<li>Uninterested in fitness benefits of cycling</li>
							<li>Has no opportunities to bicycle socially</li>
						</ul></div></div></figure>
			<section class = "dark end">
				<p>We formed an early hypothesis that some mix of cycling education or guidance could mitigate most of these deterrents. Our next step was to speak with real people to learn how cyclists of different backgrounds prioritize these factors.</p></section>
			<section class="light">
				<h1>CYCLIST INTERVIEWS</h1>
				<h2>WHAT DO CYCLIST'S PRIORITIZE?</h2>
				<p>We spoke with thirty people living in American cities, fitting a range of personal backgrounds and cycling experiences. I prepared a survey on cycling, urban transportation and fitness motivation, with hopes to learn more about beliefs and experiences of confident, motivated cyclists.</p>
				<p>We asked several background questions on users demographics and cycling histories, to ensure our audience was composed of variety of cyclists. Part of my analysis involved combining multiple responses into new variables, such as <em>cycling aptitude</em>, a variable based on responses to cycling frequency and cycling skill.</p></section>
			<figure class = "figure-grid light">
				<img style="max-width: 360px" src="/images/survey.png">
				<figcaption class="box-caption-dark">Over half of respondents are skilled enough to ride a few times a month, weather permitting</figcaption>
				<figcaption class="box-caption-light">Under a quarter of respondents don’t ride, and wouldn’t be able to without more education </figcaption></figure>
			<section class = "light">
				<p>One important takeaway from our interviews was a ranked list of factors contributing to cycling confidence, comfort and enthusiasm. We knew these were all topics we should consider addressing in our bot.</p></section>
			<figure class="data-figure">
				<h3>MOTIVATIONAL CONTRIBUTORS TO CYCLING</h3>
				<div class="data-container">
					<div class ="data-details"><h4>CONFIDENCE</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Knowing safe routes</li>
							<li>Regular practice</li>
							<li>Knowledge of riding in the dark, rain</li>
						</ol></div>
					<div class ="data-details"><h4>COMFORT</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Having appropriate equipment</li>
							<li>Riding in comfortable areas</li>
						</ol></div>
					<div class ="data-details"><h4>ENTHUSIASM</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Having places to bike to</li>
							<li>Having friends to bike with</li>
							<li>Having a fitness goal or routine</li>
						</ol></div></div></figure>

				<p>Another important conclusion came from discussions of common factors limiting respondants' cycling activity. In addition to corroborating the environmental and personal deterrents found in our literature review, we discovered many challenges that cyclists said they hesistate for weeks, months, or years to solve.</p>
				<p>The most common challenges we found, such as fixing flats, fitting helmets, or buying a new bike, typically require mechanical expertise or knowledge unfamiliar to the average cyclist. We knew our chatbot could provide this knowledge in accessible format, but didn't know if accessibility alone would solve people’s natural inertia to address big cycling challenges.</p>

			<blockquote>"We didn't know if [accessible information] alone would solve people’s natural inertia to address big cycling challenges."</blockquote>
			<div id = "line"></div>
			<p>On the topic of cycling motivation, we heard some users express explicit cycling goals, such as “cycling for the first time in years” or “taking more long rides each month.” Most people, however, articulated transportation or social goals indirectly related to cycling, such as "more daily physical activity, "less time in traffic,” "more time outdoors," or "more time with friends." We wondered if, and how, we could convince users that cycling would indirectly fulfill their personal goals.</p>

			<p>Next, before running experiments or building prototypes, I wanted to synthesize our research into user personas. Identifying and understanding the similarities in our audience would help us prioritize what to build first.</p> </section>
			<section class = "dark">
				<h1>DEVELOPING PERSONAS</h1>
				<h2>WHO ARE WE BUILDING FOR?</h2>
				<p>We aligned similar survey responses on cycling behavior, goals, and frustrations to form distinct persona archetypes. This process lead to four positive personas we would attempt to build for, and a few negative personas we would actively avoid.</p></section>
