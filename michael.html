      <h1>MICHAEL: CYCLING COMPANION</h1>
      <p>In October 2017, a friend contracted me to prototype and pitch a chatbot to his employer, an electric bike startup in San Francisco. This is the story of how I helped create a software companion to urban cyclists.</p>

<div class="dark">
  <h1>MY ROLE</h1>
  <p>I was responsible for the experience strategy of the chatbot, from preliminary research through beta testing. I also designed the character, conversation scheme, and all visual components within the chatbot interface.</p>
	<p>Development in Microsoft’s bot framework was lead by <a href="http://prakashpaudel.com">Prakash Paudel</a> with help from <a href="https://medium.com/@tkreek">Thomas Kreek</a>.</p>

  <h2>BACKSTORY</h2>
  <h1>OF BICYCLES AND CHATBOTS</h1>
  <p>This project was initiated by my past collaborator, Thomas Kreek, who for years has been frustrated by the lack of commuter cycling in the US.</p>
<p>In fall 2017, he started developing a chatbot for his employer, electric bike startup, Faraday Bicycles. He hoped a chatbot would improve customer engagement, and bring more attention to Faraday’s brand in the cycling and tech communities.</p>
<p>Faraday contracted me to build a prototype around this concept. With their brand styleguides in hand, I went to work creating a character and iOS interface around the “cycling companion” concept Thomas proposed. I used the likeness of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday">Michael Faraday</a>, famous 19th century physicist (and namesake of the company), as the chatbot character providing tools to cyclists.</p></div>
