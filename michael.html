	      <h1>MICHAEL: CYCLING COMPANION</h1>
	      <p>In October 2017, a friend contracted me to prototype and pitch a chatbot to his employer, an electric bike startup in San Francisco. This is the story of how I helped create a software companion to urban cyclists.</p></section>
			<section class="role end">
				<h1>MY ROLE</h1>
				<p>I was responsible for the experience strategy of the chatbot, from preliminary research through beta testing. I also designed the character, conversation scheme, and all visual components within the chatbot interface.</p>
				<p>Development in Microsoft’s bot framework was lead by <a href="http://prakashpaudel.com">Prakash Paudel</a> with help from <a href="https://medium.com/@tkreek">Thomas Kreek</a>.</p></section>
			<section class="light">
			  <h1>BACKSTORY</h1>
			  <h2>OF BICYCLES AND CHATBOTS</h2>
				<p>In fall 2017, my <a href="/lumened.html">past collaborator</a>, Thomas Kreek, started developing a chatbot for his employer, electric bike startup, Faraday Bicycles. Their intentions were to build a chatbot that increased customer engagement, and brought more attention to Faraday’s brand in the cycling and tech communities.</p>
				<p>Faraday contracted me to build a prototype around this concept. With their brand styleguides in hand, I went to work creating a character and iOS interface around the concept of “cycling companion.” I borrowed the likeness of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday">Michael Faraday</a>, famous 19th century physicist (and namesake of the company), as the chatbot character providing tools to cyclists.</p></section>

			<section class="light end" id="row5">
				<p>Faraday decided to pass on the project, but Thomas was enthusiastic enough to continue on his own. The vision was to create a motivational and helpful chatbot around cycling—a tool to educate and inspire cyclists, and a mascot cycling evangelists could rally behind.</p>

				<div id="line"></div>
				<p>In October 2017, he offered me and a developer friend contracts to build out a Beta version. Inspired by the mission and challenge, I accepted the contract and started planning the next 6-months. I hoped to guide our team along a design thinking process as much as possible.</p>

				<b>Afterthought: More impetus for our work</b></br>There are many benefits to cycling in a city—studies show it makes people happier and healthier. For trips under 3 miles in a city, cycling often takes equal or less time than other modes of transportation.</aside>
			<section class="dark break-end">
				<h1>LITERATURE REVIEW</h1>
				<h2>WHAT MOTIVATES CYCLISTS?</h2>
				<p>I began with a literature review with hopes to uncover documented factors leading non-cyclists to become active cyclists. While I found no causal claims about changes in cycling behavior, there were many studies on environmental and personal qualities favorable to urban cycling for transportation.</p>
				<p>I started by compiling a list of common deterrents to cycling, separating hard deterrents from those easier to overcome. Our team quickly made the decision that our software wouldn't be able to help users bypass these "hard" environmental and personal deterrents.</p>
			</section>
			<figure class="data-figure">
					<h3>HARD DETERRENTS TO CYCLING</h3>
				<div class="data-container">
					<div class ="data-details"><h4>ENVIRONMENTAL</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Lives near steep hills</li>
							<li>Relies on highways for most trips</li>
							<li>Travels more than 10 km for most trips</li>
							<li>Lives near high-traffic, poor cycling infrastructure</li>
						</ul></div>
					<div class ="data-details"><h4>PERSONAL</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Unable to cycle due to injury, illness or age</li>
							<li>Has personal distate for cycling or cyclists</li>
							<li>Must travel by car (kids, hauling, etc.)</li>
							<li>Rates comfort as highest commute concern</li>
						</ul></div></figure>
			<section class = "dark">
				<p>With more research, we learned that some environmental barrers are regularly ignored by cyclists. These "soft” environmental barriers, such as manageable traffic, small elevation changes, or commute distances under 10 km, are regularly overcome by individuals who exhibit two traits: <em>high cycling confidence</em>, and <em>high personal or social motivation to cycle.</em></p>
				<p>Building up cycling confidence and motivation seemed like a more achieveble direction for our chatbot to take. After reading more about this topic of <em>cycling self-efficacy</em>, I compiled a list of personal barriers to confidence and motivation. These were characteristics and events we would consider helping users surpass.</p></section>
				<aside> Instead, these deterrents became the basis for negative personas, or users whose problems we wouldn’t address in our Beta.</aside>
			<figure class="data-figure">
				<h3>DETERRENTS TO CYCLING SELF-EFFICACY</h3>
				<div class="data-container">
					<div class ="data-details"><h4>LOW CONFIDENCE</h4>
						<ul>
							<li> Negative prior experiences cycling</li>
							<li>No cycling ability or knowledge of rules</li>
							<li>No knowledge of local cycling infrastructure</li>
							<li>Lack of functional cycling equipment</li>
						</ul></div>
					<div class ="data-details"><h4>LOW ENTHUSIASM</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Lifestyle allows little time or energy to cycle</li>
							<li>Enjoys current transportation options</li>
							<li>Uninterested in fitness benefits of cycling</li>
							<li>Has no opportunities to bicycle socially</li>
						</ul></div></div></figure>
			<section class = "dark end">
				<p>We formed an early hypothesis that some mix of cycling education or guidance could mitigate most of these deterrents. Our next step was to speak with real people to learn how cyclists of different backgrounds prioritize these factors.</p></section>
			<section class="light">
				<h1>CYCLIST INTERVIEWS</h1>
				<h2>WHAT DO CYCLIST'S PRIORITIZE?</h2>
				<p>We spoke with thirty people living in American cities, fitting a range of personal backgrounds and cycling experiences. I prepared a survey on cycling, urban transportation and fitness motivation, with hopes to learn more about beliefs and experiences of confident, motivated cyclists.</p>
				<p>We asked several background questions on users demographics and cycling histories, to ensure our audience was composed of variety of cyclists. Part of my analysis involved combining multiple responses into new variables, such as <em>cycling aptitude</em>, a variable based on responses to cycling frequency and cycling skill.</p></section>
			<figure class = "figure-grid light">
				<img style="max-width: 360px" src="/images/survey.png">
				<figcaption class="box-caption-dark">Over half of respondents are skilled enough to ride a few times a month, weather permitting</figcaption>
				<figcaption class="box-caption-light">Under a quarter of respondents don’t ride, and wouldn’t be able to without more education </figcaption></figure>
			<section class = "light">
				<p>One important takeaway from our interviews was a ranked list of factors contributing to cycling confidence, comfort and enthusiasm. We knew these were all topics we should consider addressing in our bot.</p></section>
			<figure class="data-figure">
				<h3>MOTIVATIONAL CONTRIBUTORS TO CYCLING</h3>
				<div class="data-container">
					<div class ="data-details"><h4>CONFIDENCE</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Knowing safe routes</li>
							<li>Regular practice</li>

						</ol></div></div></figure>
			<section class = "light end">
				<p>Another important conclusion came from discussions of common factors limiting respondants' cycling activity. In addition to corroborating the environmental and personal deterrents found in our literature review, we discovered many challenges that cyclists said they hesistate for weeks, months, or years to solve.</p>
				<p>The most common challenges we found, such as fixing flats, fitting helmets, or buying a new bike, typically require mechanical expertise or knowledge unfamiliar to the average cyclist. We knew our chatbot could provide this knowledge in accessible format, but didn't know if accessibility alone would solve people’s natural inertia to address big cycling challenges.</p>
			<div id = "line"></div>
			<blockquote>"We didn't know if [accessible information] alone would solve people’s natural inertia to address big cycling challenges."</blockquote>
			<div id = "line"></div>
			<p>On the topic of cycling motivation, we heard some users express explicit cycling goals, such as “cycling for the first time in years” or “taking more long rides each month.” Most people, however, articulated transportation or social goals indirectly related to cycling, such as "more daily physical activity, "less time in traffic,” "more time outdoors," or "more time with friends." We wondered if, and how, we could convince users that cycling would indirectly fulfill their personal goals.</p>

			<blockquote>We wondered if, and how, we could convince users that cycling would indirectly fulfill their personal goals.</blockquote>

			<p>Next, before running experiments or building prototypes, I wanted to synthesize our research into user personas. Identifying and understanding the similarities in our audience would help us prioritize what to build first.</p> </section>
			<section class = "dark">
				<h1>DEVELOPING PERSONAS</h1>
				<h2>WHO ARE WE BUILDING FOR?</h2>
				<p>We aligned similar survey responses on cycling behavior, goals, and frustrations to form distinct persona archetypes. This process lead to four positive personas we would attempt to build for, and a few negative personas we would actively avoid.</p></section>
				<figure class = "figure-grid dark">

					<img class="small" src="/images/persona_details_dark.png">
				</figure>
				<section class = "dark">
				<p>Having our data points mapped to cohesive personas gave me more confidence classifying factors of confidence and motivation into real scenarios. I captured these scenarios as tasks, and categorized them into a few lists. This lead to some interesting conclusions, outlined below.</p></section>
				<figure class="data-figure">
					<h3>TASKS TO BUILD CYCLING CONFIDENCE</h3>
					<div class="data-container">
						<div class ="data-details"><h4>CONFIDENCE</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Finding motivation to start rding</li>
								<li>Developing riding skills</li>
								<li>Finding time to stay practiced</li>
							</ul></div>
						<div class ="data-details"><h4>COMFORT</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Wearing comfortable clothing</li>
								<li>Riding with a comfortable seat</li>
							</ul></div>
						<div class ="data-details"><h4>ENTHUSIASM</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Finding places to bike to</li>
								<li>Organizing social rides</li>
								<li>Starting a fitness goal or routine</li>
							</ul></div></div></figure>
				<section class = "dark">
					<h5><em>CONFIDENCE</em> TASKS ARE CRUCIAL TO IRENE</h5>
					<p class = "end">Irene is a unique persona in that she has motivation to start cycling, but has little to no confidence to start. Before any additional motivation or tools to improve cycling frequency are applicable, Irene has to get over the fears of being a non-cyclist. All of our Confidence tasks apply to Irene, as do the Routing tasks under Advanced Challenges.</p>
					<h5><em>ENTHUSIASM</em> TASKS DIFFER BETWEEN RECREATION AND TRANSPORTATION CYCLISTS</h5>
					<p class = "end">We discovered during interviews that 80% of cyclists ride for practical transportation, or recreation, but not both. Tasks related to Enthusiasm, differ for each of these two riding types. For example, recreational rides may depend on finding friends to join, whereas practical rides may depend on finding practical destinations that are bikeable. Some Enthusiasm tasks are the same, such as picking good weather to ride in.</p></section>
				<figure class="data-figure">
					<h3>DIFFICULT CHALLENGES IMPEDING CYCLISTS</h3>
					<div class="data-container">
						<div class ="data-details"><h4>EQUIPMENT</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Purchasing a new bike</li>
								<li>Finding and fiting a helmet</li>
								<li>Finding and attaching lights</li>
							</ul></div>
						<div class ="data-details"><h4>MAINTENANCE</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Checking a bike's condition</li>
								<li>Fixing a bike chain</li>
								<li>Repairing a flat tire</li>
							</ul></div>
						<div class ="data-details"><h4>ROUTES</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Assessing local rideability</li>
								<li>Finding best routes</li>
							</ul></div></div></figure>
				<section class = "dark">
					<h5><em>CHALLENGES</em> ARE RELEVANT TO ALL PERSONAS</h5>
					<p class = "end">Many of the tasks we outlined could be applicable to all of our personas. These include our Comfort tasks, and likely all of our Advanced Challenges. Many of these tasks are similar, such as, “Finding a comfortable seat” and “Finding a helmet that fits."</p></section>
				<section class = "light">
					<h1>TECHNICAL DISCOVERY</h1>
					<h2>WHAT ARE THE LIMITS TO CHATBOTS?</h2>
					<p>Before getting further into feature brainstorming, we explored the tools and restrictions different chatbot platforms afforded. We were most impressed by the flexibility and speed of building in Microsoft’s Bot Framework.</p>
					<p>As for platform options, we found the ubiquity and cross-device support of Facebook Messenger very compelling. We were concerned that users may find chatbots on Messenger unfamiliar, but ultimately decided the usefulness of Messenger would outweigh this risk. Messenger’s many conversational affordances, and the ease at which we could run tests with Facebook users, guided us towards the platform.</p>
					<p>Messenger’s tools for chatbots, inclding carousels and quick-replies, would allow us to write both sides of users’ conversations. By having users traverse dialog paths along a predetermined tree structure, we felt we could remove much of the risk traditionally associated with chatbots misinterpretting free-text responses.</p></section>
					<figure class = "data-figure">
						<h3>CONVERSATIONAL AFFORDANCES OF MESSENGER</h3>
						<div class = "data-container">
							<div class = "data-details-row">
								<h4>IMAGE CARD CAROUSELS</h4>

							</div>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<section class = "light end">
						<p>Microsoft’s natural language processing tool, LUIS, would allow us to build a machine learning-based language model trained to interpret text phrases. Many chatbots avoid supporting free-text responses, given the inherent volatility of interpretting intent from messages.</p>
						<p>We thought a careful implementation of LUIS would be focusing on mapping keywords to specific features or functions. For example, kewords such as “Weather” could map to our weather feature, and “Exit” could bring a user back to the beginning of a dialog. These functions could help users navigate to features they know, in a sense, jumping from one dialog tree structure to another.</p>
						<p>This early technical exploration gave our team a clear depiction of how a user would traverse through our chatbot.With this structure in place, we could finally start building and testing prototypes of features.</p>

						<h1>THE PRODUCT</h1>
						<h2>MICHAEL, THE CYCLING COMPANION</h2>
						<p>Michael, our product after six months of development, is a narrow-purpose AI for cyclists. He aims to make riding in a city fun, safe, and efficient. Michael has the knowledge to answer hard questions about cycling, and build confidence in new riders. For the average cyclist, he offers tools and challenges to motivate more fitness and energy conscious routines.</p>
						<p>Michael’s personality is based on the 19th century British physicist Michael Faraday. He uses a conversational interface on Facebook Messenger to provide cycling motivation and tools to riders of all skill-levels.</p></section>
					<section class = "light">
						<h2>DETAILS & PROCESS</h2>
						<h2>BUILDING AROUND A CHARACTER</h2>
						<p>We felt an important step towards motivating users would be inspiring an emotional connection between users and our bot. Towards this end, we decided to write a rich, human character behind our content. As if reading a novel, users would hopefully build empathy for our character by discovering personality and purpose in each message.</p>
						<p>We chose to base our character around the historical figure in my original prototype, 19th century British physicist, Michael Faraday. We felt his scientific background, and personality as a humble humanitarian and futurist would serve our brand intentions perfectly.</p></section>
					<figure></figure>
					<section class = "light">
						<p>Deciding on the precise copy in Michael’s messaging was an iterative process. I wrote a page of guidelines to keep us on-track in conveying his personality and purpose, while staying on-task and concise enough to function in a conversational interface.</p></section>
					<figure></figure>
					<section class="light">
						<p>Finally, we had to design a visual aesthetic to the card components sent in Messenger. We opted for a modern, but flat aesthetic, inspired in part by the historic notebooks of Michael Faraday. We outsourced illustrations to an artist I found on Behance, who did fantastic work capturing the hand-drawn sketch aesthetic we wanted to present.</p></section>
					<figure class = "end"></figure>
					<section class = "dark">
						<h2>RIDE MOTIVATION & PLANNING</h2>
						<p>With an emotional character in place, our next goal was to build motivational messages around cycling. Expert’s say the best way to change someone’s behavior is to place them in an environment where they can motivate and empower themselves. The key is knowing the environment best suited for self-motivation.</p>
						<p>Using research on deterrents from our discovery phase, I created a simple model of personal and environmental factors that lead to a self-motivating cycling environment.</p>
						<h5>STEP 1: CLEAR STATIC PERSONAL BARRIERS</h5>
						<p>As a pre-requisite to any self-motivating environment, a cyclist needs a working bike, and the confidence to ride comfortably in their local area. In accordance to our mission of helping new cyclsts, Michael’s prioriy should be to help users bypass thes obstacles by finding a bike, learning local routes, practicing riding.</p>
						<p>To accomplish this, we created our own bite-sized informational cards on cycling topics. We also built guided processes to help users understand the steps to surpassing obstacles like finding a bike, fixing a flat, etc.</p></section>
					<figure></figure>
					<section class = "dark">
						<h5>STEP 2: CLEAR DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTAL BARRIERS</h5>
						<p>Once users are capable of riding, dynamic barriers affecting day-to-day activity includes weather quality, tasks or obligations preventing cycling, and comfort level with necessary routes. It’s difficult to predict how another person will respond to these factors, therefore, motivational messages to ride or not ride on particular days have a good chance of being misguided.</p>
						<p>Instead of telling users when and when not to ride, we felt a better motivational approach was to present users with simple weather data, and easily-accessible tools to check route information and public transit status. This allows users to make their own decision, limiting the steps to checking environmental detterents.</p></section>
					<figure></figure>
					<section class = "dark">
						<h5>STEP 3: FIND HIGHER PURPOSE TO CYCLE</h5>
						<p>Once a user realizes conditions are suitable for riding, they may still decide not to bike. Michael’s last priority should be to inspire users to bicycle for a self-motivating purpose. This might be cycling for the environment, for their health, to spend more time with family, etc.</p>
						<p>To provide guidance towards these goals, we conceived of game-like experiences around cycling, where users pick a goal, receive a checklist of steps towards completion, then self-direct progress. With users as the protagonist in the game, a real-world accomplishment acts as their reward for winning, eliminating the need for fictional currencies, badges, etc.</p>
						<p>I lead design for these games, using data from our user interviews to guide many of the checkpoints and goals of the games. My teammates and I iterated on my initial designs to consider how we could maximize value from API data given our timeline.</p></section>
					<figure></figure>
					<section class = "dark">
						<p>Our end-result were games consisting of checkpoints towards reaching cycling goals, with notifications and connections to outside APIs along the way. One of my favorite games we wrote was “Zero to One,” a game utilizing questions and data to guide the user beyond their fears and barriers to cycling.</p></section>
					<figure class = "end"></figure>
					<section class = "light">
						<h1>IMPROVING USABILITY</h1>
						<p>With our core features and challenges implemented, our next step was to direct users towards the tools most relevant to their profile. We decided to use onboarding questions during users’ first login experience to understnad their cycling background. To keep the burden of this first interaction, we limited ourselves to two questions.</p>
						<p>First, we asked users to self-identify their category of cyclist, which gave us a broad idea of their profile and interests. Our second question asked users to pick a challenge that appeals most to their cycling goals. We positioned this question and decision so early in the experience so that users had an early goal and purpose to stay commited to working with Michael.</p></section>
					<figure></figure>
					<section class = "light">
						<p>Once users pick a challenge, they are sent to the chatbot’s “Home” screen. This is essentially our substitution of an app’s primary view. Whenever a user types “Home” into their chat (or synonymous utterances, e.g. “Take me home,” “Exit,” or “Restart”), they see a Messenger carousel of core features. Users can add and remove features to their Home carousel depending on what they want most easily accessible.</p></section>
					<figure></figure>
					<section class = "light">
						<p>When not launching features from the Home carousel, users’ primary touch point with Michael is through Messenger’s chat view. Using LUIS, Michael maps most free-text responses to his most relevant feature, and replies to unexpected responses with a clarifying question or error message.</p></section>
					<figure></figure>
					<section class = "light">
						<p>To account for users unfamiliar with this text-based interface or unclear of the limits to Michael’s functionality, we wanted to find another way for users to browse and launch any of Michael’s features. We used Messenger’s build-in persistent menu to accomplish this.</p></section>
