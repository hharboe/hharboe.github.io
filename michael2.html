		      <h1>MICHAEL: CYCLING COMPANION</h1>
		      <p>In October 2017, I was contracted to design the UI and persona behind an electric bicycle startup’s new chatbot. This turned into a project focused on building a Facebook Messenger chatbot that motivates users to cycle.</p>

            <h2>INITIAL CONCEPT</h2>
            <p>In fall 2017, Faraday Bicycles Inc. was exploring a new chatbot concept to help riders get more out of their electric bicycles. Thomas Kreek, an employee at Faraday, and past collaborator of mine, contracted me to build an early prototype behind their vision of a “cycling companion.”</p>

					<div class="copy">
						<p>Faraday decided to pass on the project, but Thomas was enthusiastic enough to continue on his own. In October 2017, he offered me and a developer 6-month part-time contracts to build a cycling chatbot, hoping to pitch the concept to Faraday later.</p>
						<!-- <div class = "line-mid"></div> -->
						<h2>DEFINING OBJECTIVES</h2>
						<p>My client's vision was to build functionality straddling three goals:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Education: Teach non-cylists to become capable riders</li>
							<li>Utility: Attract regular use from frequent cyclists</li>
							<li>Mascot: Create a brand cycling evangelists can rally behind</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Given our limited resources, I pushed to find one area to focus on. At the start of our contract, I lead a “NUF” (Novelty, Usefulness, Feasibility) brainstorming session to rank our potential directions.</p>

			 <div class = "row end">
				 <div class="copy">
					 <p>Further discussions revealed that cycling education was my client's preferred direction forward. Throughout development, our target success metric would be <em>the percentage of reluctant cyclists who start riding</em> after using our chatbot.</p>

					 <h1>RESEARCH</h1>
					 <h2>LITERATURE REVIEW</h2>
					 <p>My research process began by breaking down the problem of "What motivates cycles?" into specific questions, and exploring those questions in existing literature.</p>
					 <h3>1. WHICH CYCLISTS SHOULD WE TARGET?</h3>
					 <p>There is a large body of work creating typologies of American cyclists. One interesting Portland study segmented adults into four categories, based on self-rated interest and confidence:</p>
					 <ol>
						 <li><em>Strong and Fearless:</em> &nbsp;Cyclists riding multiple times per week</li>
						 <li><em>Enthused and Confident:</em> &nbsp;Cyclists eager to ride more</li>
						 <li><em>Interested but Concerned:</em> &nbsp;Non-cyclists considering starting</li>
						 <li><em>Reluctant to Cycle:</em> &nbsp;Non-cyclists facing irrevocable deterents</li></em>
					 </ol>
					 <p>We turned our focus to <em>Enthused and Confident</em>, cyclists who could use tools to plan or enjoy more rides, and <em>Interested but Concerned</em> non-cyclists, who need an extra nudge or lesson before starting.</p>
					 <h3>2. HOW DO WE HELP OUR DEMOGRAPHIC?</h3>
					 <p>While exploring factors of cycling motivation, I found many studies on cycling deterrents. Environmental barriers such as <em>hilly terrains</em>, <em>high-traffic density</em>, or <em>routes over 10km</em> are by far the most deterring. We decided early on that helping users bypass these environmental barriers would be out of scope.</p>
					 <p>When environments are slightly more favorabe to cycling, research shows that <em>confidence,</em> <em>perceived benefits of cycling</em>, and <em>social support</em> can be the next-strongest factors to promote cycling. Focusing on these factors looked like our next-best approach.</p>
					 <h3>3. WHAT IS OUR PROCESS FOR CYCLING MOTIVATION?</h3>
					 <p>As I read more into studies of motivation and behavioral change, and found a model published by Stanford University’s Persuasive Technology Lab. This model served as inspiration for the educative process we would design for our target demographic.</p>
				 </div>

			 <figure class = "fig-single-caption">
				 <div><img class = "img-med" src = "/images2/michael/fogg.png"></div>
				 <figcaption class = "single-caption img-med">BJ Fogg’s model shows that Motivation, Ability, and Triggers must converge at the same moment for a behavior to occur</figcaption>
			 </figure>
			 <div class = "row">
				 <div class="copy">
					 <p>At the end of my literature review, we wrote our own process to convince our demographic to start cycling regularly.</p>

				 <div class="copy">
					 <p>First, users had to find a purpose to cycle to renew their interest. Then, access to confidence-boosting tools would enable users to commit to the proces. Finally, motivational triggers would inspire behavioral change over time.</p>
					 <h2>USER INTERVIEWS</h2>
					 <p>To better understand the priorities in our target demographic, we spoke with 20 adults across a range of demographics, cities, and cycling aptitudes. We asked questions about recent cycling experiences, fitness and cycling goals, and priorities when making riding decisions.</p>
					 <p>I formed distinct persona archetypes by aligning similar responses from interview subjects. This lead to three positive personas we would build for, and three we would avoid.</p>

					 <h2>EXPLORING TECH CONSTRAINTS</h2>
					 <p>Before any prototyping, we had to decide whether we wanted to release our chatbot in a native app, or through a chatbot platform like Facebook Messenger or Slack. We opted to release on Facebook Messenger, partially because of its cross-device support and ubiquity, and partially due to our limited budget and timeline.</p>
					 <h3>TWO-SIDED CONVERSATIONS</h3>
					 <p>We found that Messenger offered a few unique chatbot affordances: Card Carousels and Quick Replies.</p>
				 </div>
			 </div>
			 <div class = "row">
				 <figure class = "fig-multi-caption">
					 <div><img class = "img-gif" src = "/images2/michael/carousel.png"></div>
					 <figcaption class = "multi-caption img-gif">Messenger’s card carousels support images, descrriptions, and buttons</figcaption>

					 <figcaption class = "multi-caption img-gif">Messenger’s quick replies support multiple-choice type questions</figcaption>
				</figure>
			 </div>
			 <div class = "row">
				 <div class="copy">
					 <p><em>Card Carousels</em> and <em>Quick Replies</em> would allow us to write both sides of users' conversations. Traversing users through predetermined conversation paths would hopefully avoid most instances of misinterpretted user intent.</p>
					 <h3>SUPPORTING FREE-TEXT USER ENTRIES</h3>
					 <p>Microsoft’s Bot Framework gave us access to LUIS, a natural language processing tool. LUIS would allow us to train a machine learning-based language model to interpret users’ messages and direct them to a particular chatbot function.</p>

			 </figure>
			 <div class = "row end">
				 <div class="copy">
					 <p>We hoped supporting free text responses would be necessary given users’ experience and understanding of the Messenger interface. As an added benefit, we could map user-inputted keywords to common features or functions. For example, keywords such as “Weather” or “Exit” could respectively direct users to our weather feature, or escape from the middle of an in-progress conversation.</p>

					 <h1>DESIGN</h1>
					 <h2>BUILDING A CHARACTER</h2>
					 <p>My client was adamant about designing a rich character behind our chatbot’s messaging, to inspire emotional connections from our users. Keeping my original concept of Michael Faraday, I wrote guidelines for how our team should write conversation flows.</p>
				 </div>
			 </div>
			 <div class = "row">
				 <div class="center-copy row-paragraph">
					 <h3>1. MAINTAIN PERSONALITY</h3>
					 <ul>
						<li>Write in-character with familiar language</li>
						<li>Avoid monotonous enthusiasm; excessive '!’s</li>
						<li>Avoid platitudes; emphasize factual statements</li>
					</ul>
					<h4><s>“Everyone can ride if the weather’s nice!”</s></h4>
					<h4>"Cycling in a t-shirt is comfortable above 70°.”</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="center-copy row-paragraph">
					<h3>2. BUILD USER CONFIDENCE</h3>
					<ul>
					 <li>Treat users as if they're confident</li>
					 <li>Ask users to one-up their presonal best</li>
					 <li>Avoid vapid praise, recognize accomplishments</li>
				 </ul>
				 <h4><s>“Great job! You are doing amazing.”</s></h4>
				 <h4>“21 miles cycled this week. How about 30 next week?”</h4>
			 </div>
		 </div>
		 <figure class = "fig-single-caption">
			 <figcaption class = "single-caption">Above is a sample from my full list of guidelines, published <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Dialogue-Style-Guide-nSx8XXsOCb9MGjDOXsorh">here</a>.</figcaption>
		 </figure>
		 <div class = "row">
			 <div class="copy">
				 <p>My guidelines were inspired by a few books and articles on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12910715-designing-for-emotion">designing for emotion</a>, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/legibility-readability-comprehension/">writing for mobile interfaces</a>, and <a href-"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32758034-designing-bots">avoiding common pitfalls</a> of monotonous software characters.</p>
				 <h2>DESIGNING EDUCATION</h2>
				 <p>The first education feature we worked on were <em>Knowledge Cards</em>, images providing bite-size motivational and confidence-boosting information on topics and tasks we identified were important or challenging for our users.</p>
			 </div>
		 </div>
		 <figure class = "fig-multi-caption">
			 <div class = "img-gif">
			 <video autoplay loop class = "img-gif" src = "/images2/michael/captures/knowledge.mov">
			 </div>
			 <figcaption class = "multi-caption img-gif">Users could browse cards by topic after selecting “Cycling Guide” from our menu</figcaption>
		 </figure>
		 <div class = "row">
			<div class="copy">
			 <p>Early usability testing revealed that non-cyclists felt intimidated when asked to explore cards by topic. One user said, <em>“This is hard for me to get through, because, to be honest, I’m not sure what I don’t know.”</em> Another user said, <em>“I can see how this would help people, but it’s too tedious for me.”</em></p>
			 <p>I identified two problems with our current design based on feedback:</p>
			 <ol>
				 <li>Lack of context: Knowledge Cards alone were not substantial 		enough to create a lasting effect on users’ confidence.</li>
				 <li>Poor navigation: Our navigation structure for Knowledge Cards did not match users’ mental models for learning</li>
			 </ol>
			 <h3>CONSIDERING SCENARIOS TO IMPROVE CONTEXT</h3>
			 <p>To add substance to users' interaction with Knowledge Cards, we wrote conversational procedures that included multiple cards, calls to APIs, and even reminders to finish tasks. We mapped these procedures to complicated scenarios that single cards could not address on their own.</p>
		 	</div>

	 	 </figure>
	 	 <div class = "row">
		 	<div class="copy">
			 <h3>CONSIDERING MENTAL MODELS TO IMPROVE NAVIGATION</h3>
			 <p>Our solution to the navigation problem was allowing users to interact with our Knowledge Cards in a question-and-answer format. Users would be able to ask unique questions from our chatbot, and our language model would map their question to the best-fitting card.</p>

		<div class = "row">
			<div class="copy">
				<h3>GOING ONE STEP FURTHER WITH GAMIFICATION</h3>
				<p>With intentions to increase user engagement, my client directed me to write text-based, educational games around our existing features. His vision was to provide users with end-to-end guidance along real-world goals, e.g. learning to cycle in traffic, or attempting a commute to work.</p>
				<p>We brainstormed ideas for these games, and sent a web survey asking participants to rank each concept. After identifying the three games most popular for each persona type, I wrote outlines for the three games in collaboration with my developer.</p>

		<div class = "row">
			<div class="copy">
				<p>With approval from our client, I started writing detailed game logic and conversation scripts, and my developer started development. Designing, developing, and shipping three games took over a month to complete.</p>

				<h3>BUILDING HABITS INTO ONBOARDING</h3>
				<p>Once our games were live, I added a simple onboarding process during users’ first login. The onboarding process asked users to self-select their persona type, and a game that best fits their cycling goals. I also used this opportunity to introduce users to our character, recommend tools they may find useful, and share two helpful navigation tricks.</p>

				<h1>ASSESSING IMPACT</h1>
				<h2>IDENTIFYING POOR DECISIONS</h2>
				<p>In our last few weeks, we made a big push for more users, but received a lackluster response. While disappointed, we were not overly surprised. We had received plenty of skepticism towards our product concept.</p>
				<p>As I reached the end of my six month contract, I had many ideas where  both I and our team could have made different decision to benefit the outcome of the project. I think two changes would have had the most impact.</p>
				<h3>STARTING WITH A PRODUCT IN MIND</h3>
				<p>This project began as a product searching for a user base, which ultimately clouded our decision-making throughout the project. When faced with low interst, our efforts to course-correct were often directed towards the initial vision, rather than exploring new ideas which may have better solved user needs.</p>
				<p>I wish I had pushed back on my client’s product vision, and encouraged open-mindedness while exploring solutions to the problem. Considering platforms outside of chatbots, and directions outside of broad, full-service motivation might have lead to a more successful solution.
				<h3>TAKING TOO BROAD AN APPROACH TO PROBLEM SOLVING</h3>
				<p>While games, our most developed feature, were built on sound motivational tactics, they were limited by the problems we failed to solve for users. By focusing on full-service motivation, we were ignoring the details of users’ emotions and experiences within each step of the process. As a result, our motivational triggers failed to be convincing, and became more annoying than useful.</p>
				<p>Were I to start this project again, I would pick a problem identified in our research phase, such as bicycle purchasing or commute planning, and use more research methods to understand it deeply. In-person research such as ride-alongs, shop-alongs, repair-alongs, could have uncovered rich insights that lead to more focused, and potentially successful solution.</p>
