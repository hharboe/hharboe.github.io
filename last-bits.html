      <h2>IMMERSING OURSELVES IN 'GLOBAL EDUCATION'</h2>
      <p>We came back from our pilot wanting to learn more about what 'global education' means to American K-8 schools. It was a topic growing in popularity across American school curricula, and had become an institution-wide focus for some schools and <a href="https://gebg.org">consortiums</a>. One popular and affordable approach to global education we found was organizing projects between international classrooms.</p>
      <p>We spoke with <a href="https://iearn.org/about">two</a> <a href = "http://www.globaleducationconference.org/page/our-mission">organizations</a> and <a href="http://www.penpalschools.com">one startup</a> assisting teachers with these projects, and asked what factors they felt were most crucial to success. We coupled their responses with feedback from our pilot program teachers to create a list of requirements for our own program.</p>

  <h3>GLOBAL PROJECTS ANALYSIS</h3>
  </div>
  <div class = "data-wrapper">
    <div class = "data-container">
      <h4>PROJECT GOALS</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Teachers have unique project ideas they want their students to collaborate on with partners abroad. This generally includes writing, reading, presentating, and sometimes an artistic element.</li>
          <li>Teachers have a hard time finding classrooms to partner with. Once they find a partner, communicating clear expecations and maintaining a relationship is a significant challenge.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class = "data-container">
      <h4>TECHNICAL PAIN POINTS</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Timezone and language differences can complicate communication in myriad ways. Skype is often unusable due to these factors, in addition to unpredictable internet quality</li>
          <li>Teachers use whatever tools they can find to make these projects happen. Email, Google Drive, and Twitter, and message boards are popular ways to share materials.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class = "data-container">
      <h4>PILOT PROGRAM FEEDBACK</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Teachers have no problem recording videos or having students record videos, but editing is a process they could use help with</li>
          <li>Weekly exchanges were impractical, and monthly exchanges were too infrequent. Bi-weekly projects was a happy medium</li>
          <li>Older classrooms wanted to take an active role in the planning and editing of projects</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>CREATING A COMPELLING PROGRAM AROUND VIDEO</h2>
    <p>We were confident our video exchange program, now titled <em>Video Pen Pals</em>, would fit most teacher's pedagogical interests, provided we could make relationships and technology easy to manage. We launched a website next, with mockups of curricula and software products, to start the sales process with schools.</p>
    <h3 style = "padding-top: 1.5em">MULTI-LAYERED LEARNING APPROACH</h3>
    <p>We put our program's unique, multi-layered pedalogical approach at the front of our marketing materials. This included two distinct topic areas designed for a younger and older group of students.</p>

    <h3>CONFIDENCE-BUILDING VIDEO SOFTWARE</h3>
    <p>Our video software highlighted simple recording and editing. Our messaging and video exchange portal emphasized that the burden of managing logistics fell to LumenEd, and that support was always a quick message away.<p>

    <h3>LOW-COMMITMENT EARLY ENROLLMENT</h3>
    <p>Our website used a low-commitment call-to-action, asking teachers to reserve a spot rather than enroll early. This allowed us to start dialogs and learn from our first customers, rather than isolate them with a schedule or price that didn't fit.</p>

    <h2>INCORPORATING THE BRIGHT ORANGE BOX</h2>
    <p>As an organization, we saw a path forward that dropped the Bright Orange Box and focused on selling Video Pen Pals to well-off schools already equipped with technology. While this would be a low-risk business direction, it would be a partial abandonment of our founding mission and traction using the BOB to impact offline, disconnected classrooms.</p>
    <div class="line-mid"></div>
    <blockquote>"We saw a path forward that dropped the Bright Orange Box... While this would be a low-risk business direction, it would be a partial abandonment of our founding mission."</blockquote>
    <div class="line-mid"></div>
    <p>We decided to pursue a dual-focused path for the upcoming year: earn revenue from schools through Video Pen Pals, and invest funds into BOB manufacturing. Distributing BOBs to a diverse set of international NGOs would eventually yield its own revenue, and simultaneously expand the reach of Video Pen Pals. The model was risky and complicated, but would fully satisfy our mission if successful.</p>

      <h1>TRANSITIONING TO FULL-TIME</h1>
      <h2>FUNDRAISING CHALLENGES</h2>
      <p>After deciding to pursue LumenEd full-time after school, we set a goal to raise $200k by the day we graduated. These funds would support a year of operations and a manufacturing run of 250 Bright Orange Boxes. Our primary fundraising sources were classroom pre-sales and a Kickstarter campaign. We also began sending applications to social impact grants and looking to network with angel investors.</p>
      <h3>PRE-SALES ARE RARE IN EDTECH</h3>
      <p>Pre-sales were our preferred fundraising method, as we knew early sales traction would make us more attractive to investors. We tested this approach in March with our pilot schools, offering a 25% discount and special perks in exchange for an early commitment to the fall. While every pilot school was interested in the opportunity, not one was able to commit funds so early.</p>

      <p>As the year went by, we gained more traction by writing to more schools. We made sales trips over Spring Break to schools in Cleveland, New York, and D.C., where we were able to secure about $10k in our accounts receivable that summer.</p>
      <h3>KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGNS CAN BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING</h3>
      <p>Succeeding on Kickstarter would simultaneously raise capital, and earn us a story in EdTech journals that may catch attention from prospective schools. We went through several drafts of campaign videos, award ideas, and outreach to news outlets before our campaignwent live, a process that took significantly longer than expected.</p>

      <p>We didn't have enough time to get many verbal commitments ahead of time, so outreach to friends, family, and alumni was an all-hands task while the campaign was live. We <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1066037724/the-bright-orange-box-connecting-classrooms">succeeded in raising $40,000</a> one day before our deadline, in large part due to generosity and interest from Oberlin College alumni.</p>
      <p>The day after we graduated, we moved into a temporary office in Oberlin for the summer. We had a total of $50k to assemble 50 units of the new Bright Orange Box. Much of my time the next two months would be spent selling Video Pen Pals to K-8 schools, our sole source of revenue for the upcoming year.</p>

      <h2>FULL-TIME DIRECT SALES</h2>
      <p>Our sales strategy began with a focus on direct sales top-tier K-8 schools across the US, in particular those with a service- or global education-related mission statement. We started charging $2000 per classroom per year, which we explained sponsored a Bright Orange Box for a partner classroom and covered our overhead costs. The first schools we enrolled accepted this price graciously, enrolling multiple classrooms for an average deal-size of $4000 per school. </p>
      <p>As we got further into the summer, we found that $2000 per classroom was prohibitive for most schools. We started discounting after honest conversations with schools' on their ability-to-pay, and  our lowest price dropped to $399 per classroom per year. This new price was unsustainable in our current hardware-driven model, informing us that costs had to be cut before our program could scale.</p>
      <div id="line"></div>
      <blockquote>"This new price was unsustainable in our current hardware-driven model, informing us that costs had to be cut before our program could scale."</blockquote>
      <div id="line"></div>
      <p> We left the summer with $45,000 in revenue from direct sales. Direct sales, while effective at communicating our unique value and justifying our price point, lead to less sales volume than we hoped. We planned to find additional sales channels in the future aside from repeating our lengthy, high-touch approach.</p>
      <h2>LAUNCHING PARTNERSHIPS AND PRODUCTS</h2>
      <p>With our summer lease up, we moved operations to Chicago in the fall where we would release our video exchange software, finish BOB assembly, and launch Video Pen Pals with 25 classrooms on each side. We hit other milestones along the way:

      <h1>PLANNING THE FUTURE</h1>
      <h2>GEARING UP FOR NEXT YEAR'S SALES</h2>
      <p>We started planning for our second year of sales in the winter of 2016. We had a better understanding of our target schools' needs and wanted to refresh our curriculum, marketing materials, and website. We also had plans to pursue new sales channels outside of cold outreach.</p>
      <h3>REFRESHING OUR CURRICULUM</h3>
      <p>Our previous year's curriculum was been focused on cultural sharing and expressing identity, topics admittingly more relevant to elementary school classrooms than middle or high schoolers. In our second year, we split topics into three topic tracks, with two new tracks aimed for older students.</p>

      <h3>INCREASING ENROLLMENT FLEXIBILITY</h3>
      <p>We broke our full-year program into multi-week units for a few reasons: The first two reasons were to accomodate teachers with shorter time-frames and allow classrooms to enroll in multiple programs per year. Our third reason was to replace our full-year discounted program with a single-unit program at the same price. This would allow us to include small budget schools in our program, without enduring the overhead cost of managing a full-year program.</p>

      <p>In effort to make the sales process more hands-off than the year before, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522032946/http://lumened.org/">revamped our website</a> with more program details, FAQ, and a sign-up process for classrooms. We also refreshed the look of our website, adding more color, illustrations, and animations to match the friendly aesthetic of our brand.</p>

      <h3>ADDING NEW SALES CHANNELS</h3>
      <p>Part of our new sales strategy was to reach schools through organizations and school consortiums, in hopes to increase enrollment and deal sizes with a similar amount of marketing effort. We also posted actively in online global education communities, with the intentions of attracting teachers and schools outside our immediate network.</p>

      <h1>THE LAST 6 MONTHS</h1>
      <h2>LAST CALL FOR FUNDRAISING</h2>
      <p>By the end of winter, we were in desperate need of outside fundraising. We had exhausted all our cash, and were borrowing funds from friends and family to cover our $5k/month burn rate. We had some revenue coming in from BOB sales, but the bulk of our income from Video Pen Pals would not arrive for several months.</p>
      <h3>PUSHING CHICAGO'S INVESTOR NETWORK</h3>
      <p>Our advisor network attempted to connect us with local angel investors, including several people at Chicago's primary entrepreneurship center, <a href="https://1871.com/">1871</a>. We were able to network with local startups and pitch at two new startup competitions at 1871, but in the end none of these connections lead to fundraising traction.</p>

  <div class = "row">
    <div class = "copy">
      <p>By March, LumenEd's next year was in jeopardy after we spent the last of our borrowed $20k. We needed to borrow $30k more to cover overhead costs before we collected more revenue in August. This new debt would not cover our growth expenses, which included increased sales and marketing and several software updates. Our only options forward were to raise funds or secure early pre-sales.</p>
      <h3>HONEST COMMUNICATION WITH SCHOOLS</h3>
      <p>Frustrated with our fundraising network in Chicago, we turned to our highest-profile schools for help. We sent 75 schools a personalized letter, explaining that we wanted to offer the program again, but could not guarantee we could afford it. We asked schools to express their interest early, in exchange for a discount. We also candidly asked for any introductions to aid in our fundraising round.</p>

    </div>
  </figure>
  <div class = "row">
    <div class = "copy">
      <p>A month after sending the letters and following-up, we had received only a handful of commitments, all of which were re-enrollments. We had made no further traction with new schools, and had found our attempt to network with investors through schools unsuccessful.</p>
      <h3>ADMITTING WE WERE BURNED OUT</h3>
      <p>Without cash to spend on growth, our core team's only path forward was six months of grueling hours, picking up the marketing, sales, and development tasks we had planned to split with 1-2 new hires. Even if we were successful, we would have little to no time for proactive fundraising, which would be necessary to carry us into 2017. Without a successful fundraising round, we would be forced to cancel the 2016-17 program mid-year and refund schools' payments.</p>
      <p>To compound on financial woes, our team was starting to feel burned out after three years of intense bootstrapping. In May, after several deliberations, we wrote to our advisors and customers that LumenEd was closing before the 2016-17 school year began. Later that month, the three of us found jobs in Chicago and started paying off the company's debt.</p>
